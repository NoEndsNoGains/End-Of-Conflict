_Summary (Back Cover):_

You're fighting glass. Here's how to check.

A framework for hopeless conflict.

Tables. Checklists. Templates. The precision of a workbook.

And then: art. Images that land before words do. A picture book a child can flip through. A book an academic can cite.

Most conflicts persist not because they're unsolvable — but because we skip the steps resolution requires. We don't name them clearly. We assume instead of verify. We judge people before consequences. We confuse the verdict with the sentence. We talk without acting.

Five stages: Map it. See it. Judge it. Choose it. Do it.

Underneath: an engine room. A Truth Tester that reveals we can only resolve what we capture — and what we capture is always incomplete. A Living Protocol that breaks every claim on purpose. An Immunity Paradox that explains why we keep failing: mapping symptoms instead of triggers, responding with blunt instruments, forgetting everything the moment the ceasefire is signed.

Simple enough for 2am. Rigorous enough for court.

It doesn't promise magic. It promises the best of what's possible — and shows you exactly where that boundary lies.


_Prologue_

**Foreword: Beautiful, Dramatic, Tragic**

We, you, I—aren't we beautiful, dramatic, and tragic all at once?

A bit like the betta fish.

Stunning creature. Iridescent. Fins like silk. Put a mirror in the tank and it attacks. Flares and exhausts itself against an enemy that isn't there. It's fighting a projection. Not reality.

It can do this until it dies.

In conflict, we're betta fish. Fighting our own reflection. Exhausting ourselves against glass.

This book won't make you peaceful. Some conflicts are real. Some enemies aren't reflections.

But most of the time? We're attacking the mirror.

This framework is how you check.

Stop fighting the glass.
