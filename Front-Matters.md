## Prologue


## The Shit We Carry

You're full of shit. So am I. So is everyone ever touched by conflict.

But not all shit is the same. Some we create. Some gets put in us.

Weapon we throw, or wound forced into us—in conflict, we all end up the same: full of it.

And the moment we respond, we either sustain or we resolve. There is no neutral. There is no clean.

Brutal? Yes. Shocking? Yes.

Especially if you're that child who didn't choose. Especially if you're that mother who lost her mind to grief. They didn't pick this. They don't deserve it. Her hearing "you're full of shit" isn't an invitation to self-reflection. It's cruelty.

And we grow up. The child becomes a mother. The mother becomes a soldier.

And still—whether you are the one who is wounded or the one who wounds—what comes next is the same: we build stories. Stories to survive. Stories to justify. Stories to protect. Stories where each of us is the traumatised victim, even when we are both the one being dropped on and the one who drops. Wounded, we wound. Wounding, we feel wounded. Like a breath in and breath out. The vicious circle.

That's the shit—the shit we all need to survive. Self-deception like a heartbeat, sustaining our aliveness. It's not a moral judgment. It's just how it works. Chosen or not, the result is the same: now, we are all full of it.

---

## The Time of Too Much

In our beautiful human nature, at first, we just get lost. It's too dark, too sticky, too confusing. Shocked and blinded, we panic or freeze. The smell of fear or terror does not allow us to reason.

So we don't. That's not blame. Again: it is simply how it is. You can't reason when shit drops on you or when in anger and despair we drop it.

And if you're in active crisis—unsafe, your basic needs unmet—you may need care, protection, or justice first. This is not a failure. It's triage.

For resolution, you need to allow time. Time to be shattered. Time to shake the shock off. Time to let gravity work. Time to let things settle. Time to let the pain rest. Time.

Time prepares you for the moment when you are ready to look around at your own doing and your own receiving without the looking crushing you.

You can't do that in *the time of too much*. Too much pain, too much fear, too much anger. In *the time of too much*, self-deception is the only right. It's justified. It's protective. It lets you survive. And you need to survive—because if you can't survive, who else is there to end it?

---

## The Burden

This book is for the time when situation becomes a bit more bearable. Accustomed. Habituated. For the moment when you realise: regardless of whether it was given or chosen—what you do with this mess is yours.

Oh, imagine if we got there quickly. Wouldn't that be just the best? Because only then—only then—can we change things. Before that, we're just lost.

And, no, no, no. Gaining the *reason* back does not make it any easier. Perhaps that is where the hard part really starts. And there are so many hard parts.

How about the one where you realise the ones who neither deserved nor chose it might have the biggest chance of ending it? How much wiser are you than those who harmed you? How can you expect that maturity from them? You can't. So it falls to you.

Unfair? Yes. Unacceptable? Yes.

Because a path of resolution is based on your continuous choice. And that choice might be unbearable. You might be the only one who chooses not to stay in the game. The only one ready to look. The only one ready to lose. The only one who knows why.

It's like knowing you will be continuously slapped in the face—and even knowing that's exactly what will happen, deciding you will choose not to slap back.

And it might be that you keep choosing this while the game continues. While somebody else chooses something else entirely. While they keep playing the old way. While the pattern repeats.

Again.

And again.

---

## The Promise

So then you ask yourself: what's the point? If my choosing doesn't end the conflict, why would I choose this? Why?

Here's why.

Because you suddenly realise: all of this is a game. It's only a game. And for the game to continue, the game needs you to slap back.

And then the penny drops. It was never about winning. It was never about being right. It was just about continuing.

And the penny drops again. Those who are the real winners, *the real winners*, and those who are the only right, *the only right*, are those who saw it first.

This book doesn't promise to end the conflict. It helps you see what the game is about.

And that—just that—gets you closer to your freedom.

Not their freedom. Your freedom. That's the only territory you ever control anyway. The territory where the choice ends the game.

---

## The Monsters

But the path to freedom has its own monsters.

I'm not thinking Putin. I'm not thinking Hitler. I'm not thinking Stalin.

I'm thinking about the real monsters. The most dangerous of them all.

<img width="1024" height="1024" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/65a97341-2960-4d33-8fd7-afb1d17615cc" />


The wounded-wounding story from the start—where we wound because we were wounded, where we feel wounded even as we wound. The vicious circle that feels like breathing.

And there are the Clean Stories. The stories of "I am not in it" or "it's not mine." I didn't drop nor was it dropped on me. The many versions of why your hands are clean. Like "just processing the paperwork." Like "just following procedure." Like "I am here. They are there. Just paying my taxes." Just looking away. Just staying neutral. Just minding your own business.

And there are the stories of being too polite, too delicate, too posh, too important, too academic, too *something* to acknowledge openly that you are in it. Including the stories of being too kind, too genuine, too mature to ever believe that you are in it, too.

So how about a little reality check?

Because you see, it's just possible that however polite, however kind, however genuine, however mature, however important, however posh, however delicate, however academic, however *whatever*—none of the stories lets you off.

You see, the 2am reader isn't just the parent in court. It's the parent who instructed the solicitor to file the documents. It's the judge who saw the pattern and didn't name it. It's the policy-maker who designed the system. It's the voter who tolerates it.

And there is the 'it's not my fault' story. The 'it's pure genocide' story. The 'I'm not in the conflict—I'm just selling the guns' story.

The question isn't whether you're in it. It's *how*.

And then there's the biggest monster. The one we don't even recognise as a story.

Being right.

Being right feels so good. Would you like me to tell you that story now? Yes, you're right. Yes, yes, you're right. Yes, you suffered. Yes and yes and yes.

Feels good?

Then continue. You've been here once—or thousands of times before. Humans like repetition, so repeat. Be right. Have it.

But you need to know that by being right, you are making a choice. A choice between being right and being free. Please don't be delusional. You can't have both. Being right does not equal being free.

How is that even possible? How come being right does not equal being free?

Because being right requires a loser. And losers don't go quietly—they resist, they defend, they fight back. The very act of claiming rightness creates the opposition that traps you. You need them to accept being wrong for your rightness to be complete. But even if they do, it doesn't feel right anymore. And if they won't, it's because they can't. And they can't because every victim is also an abuser. And every abuser is also a victim. That's why it can't be just one. It can't be just right.

Your desire to be right always ends one of two ways: you never get it, or you get a right that doesn't feel right anymore.

But it gets even more uncomfortable. Because proving you are right—you add to the game. You support the conflict. You enable it to continue.

Freedom comes from stepping out of the right/wrong game entirely. Not "I'm right and you're wrong" or even "we're both right"—but dropping the whole framework of needing to be right at all.

That's the real uncomfortable truth.

So if what you need most of all is to _be right-, this is where this book ends for you. Money back not guaranteed.

But at least you stay right and you stay full of shit.

Ouch! Was I too direct?

Rude? Disrespectful? Unhinged?

PLAINLY WRONG!!!

Yes. You're right. Again.

And that's the proof. Your outrage is the game continuing. With whoever. Whenever.

Hi. Nice to meet you. 

You were saying...? What's your name?... Did our great-great grandmothers...? Yes... I think that is right! We're all the same!

But if you want another fight—not with me, not in here.

Slap. I mean, no slap.

---

## The Tank

But hey, who cares? Why even think about it? I tell you, let's just not think. Let's just not ask. Shall we talk about the weather and how good your dinner was last night? I had cheesy pasta. You?

The only thing is I can't take it any more. I can't pretend I don't know when I know. Like, we think the glass separates us from the conflict. But there is no separation. The tank is bigger than you think. Two kinds of shit in the same water. And I know I am in it and I know you're in it. So full of shit you can't see anything else. Like a fish that knows nothing but water. But in conflict, we are not any fish. We are betta fish. Stunning creatures—iridescent, fins like silk. Put a mirror in the tank and they attack.


<img width="1024" height="1024" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d7e79d1a-3b88-406d-9b84-93a734494fd3" />


Who wants to see their own shit? No one. So they flare. Exhaust themselves protecting a story that feels so *true*, so *just*, so *right*. The betta fish fighting glass, believing they fight a real enemy—when it isn't even there. And the greatest enemy? The one in you who already knows the only way is peace.

If that helps, I won't admit I know and I won't remind you that you know it too.

Better? Yes. Cosier? Yes.

You see, I know how to behave when I want to.

---

## The Invitation

And if you stayed—well, that says it all.

A bit desperate. A bit past the point of no return. Out of options. With *staying* being the only option left. However uncomfortable it might get.

What? Did I guess? Am I right?

No. I'd better not be. By now, we all know how the "I'm right" story ends.

And if you are here—if you got this far—you already suspect. You suspect you might be full of shit. And because you suspect, you must be smart. Smart enough to know that this unkind, rude, judgemental phrase is nothing more than an invitation.

Not an accusation. An invitation.

To see the wholeness. The full extent of it. All of it. Yours. Theirs. The mess itself.

Clarity is your reward. And this book is nothing but a system to get you there.

So the fact that you are still reading this tells us so much.

Because you staying—continuing to read after I called you full of shit, after I set a trap and watched to see if you'd fall in, after I at least attempted to humiliate you—means that you are ready to step down from your throne of being right. You are ready to bow. Not to me. But to peace.

And that tells us all we need to know.

You stayed. Even though you have been provoked, you stayed. Even though you know how hard this will be, you stayed. You stayed regardless of how I behaved.

Because of that, how can I not think that you must be:

A little cool.
Certainly a little curious.
Most of all, perhaps a little brave.
With at least a little grace.
And definitely with so much needed wisdom.

And if you have all of those qualities, you are my hero.

You must know that I count on you. Because we need the curious ones. The brave ones. The graceful ones. The wise ones.

Conflict needs people like you.

P.S. 
Let me MAP what just happened.

There's you and there's me, and I'm playing a game with you. The game is ultimately for me to know if you're the right reader for this book, and for you to decide if you're ready for it.

Now you CHECK. What you're checking is how each of us plays. If you check, you'll notice I used a classic sales technique: breakdown followed by love-bombing. I called you full of shit, set traps, admitted to attempting humiliation—then pivoted to calling you cool, curious, brave, graceful, wise. My hero.
We don't have data about your behaviour—we don't know what you said or thought or felt. But for the purpose of this exercise, we will JUDGE. Does naming the manipulation neutralise it? Or does self-awareness just make it sophisticated manipulation? How about your assumptions and preferences? Does liking me a little—you must be liking me at least somewhat if you got this far—have an impact on how you judged what I said and what I did?

Then you DECIDE what that means for your trust in this book. In me. And ultimately, whether to keep reading—because that's the actual decision in front of you right now.

And based on that, you ACT. Perhaps you:

- Close the book. Fair.
- Keep reading but more skeptically. Smart.
- Call my mom and tell her she raised me badly. Here's her number: [redacted for her protection, not mine].

Whatever you choose: you just used the framework. On me. Pedagogy in practice. 

---
# The River

And here's where I need to be precise.

This framework will be weaponised.

Not "could be." Will be.

Didn't I just weaponise everything in this prologue? Manipulation dressed as honesty. Traps dressed as invitations. Self-awareness dressed as virtue.

So yes. Someone will read this and use it to tell their ex-wife she's full of shit while refusing to look at themselves. Someone will cite the Immunity Paradox to explain why they can't possibly change. Someone will wave this book at a judge and say "see, we're all biased, so my bias doesn't count."

The framework has tools to catch this. Step two is CHECK—look at what's actually happening. Step three is JUDGE—evaluate it precisely. These tools exist.

But can the framework guarantee they'll be used honestly?

No.

Because we're all full of shit. That includes the institutions that make the final decisions. That includes the UN Security Council, designed to deadlock the moment it matters most. That includes NATO. That includes the signatories of the Budapest Memorandum—the US, the UK, Russia—who promised Ukraine security guarantees in exchange for nuclear disarmament, and then watched. That includes the ICC, issuing warrants it cannot enforce. That includes me, writing this. That includes you, reading it.

And here's the deeper problem: some conflicts don't end because ending them would mean facing what was done to keep them going.

Do you understand what that would require? People taking responsibility. More specifically, people in power taking responsibility. That would mean a loss of that power. That would mean consequences. That would mean—

No. They won't.

Every participant accumulates reasons not to look. The longer the conflict, the more there is not to see. The more there is not to see, the harder it becomes to stop.

This is the river at your back. You've crossed lines that can't be uncrossed. And now the only direction is forward—because backward means facing what you did to get here.

The framework can't save us from ourselves. It can only show us what we've done. What we're doing. What we keep doing.

And it's safe. That's the thing. It's completely safe. Nobody has to know. You can do this alone, in your bed, at 2am. No witnesses. No judgment. Just you and the mirror.

The only question is: why would you want to look?

Isn't it nicer not to know?

Isn't it easier to keep the story? The one where you're right. The one where they're wrong. The one where you didn't have a choice. The one where you did what anyone would do.

Why would you trade that for sight?

I have no idea what your reason might be.

But I know what mine is.

I want power. Lots of it. All of it. I want the kind of power that's unbreakable. Undefeatable. Unshakable. The kind no one can take from you because it doesn't depend on them. The kind that doesn't need their agreement, their approval, their surrender.

That power is clarity.

When you've looked—really looked—at your own shit, something shifts. You become wiser, kinder, gentler. Not from pressure. From understanding how it works. The game. The patterns. The moves. Yours and theirs.

The reward: the power, the freedom of choice. Yours.

That's what the framework gives you. Not peace. Not harmony. Not the warm feeling of resolution.

Sight.

Do you want that power?

That real power?

I do.

---

## The Trap

The only thing is, none of this will help you get through the book. The book is hard work. Unbelievably hard work.

For starters, shit smells, and it's certainly not a nice thing to look at. (Isn't that the most academic of my sentences yet?)

But here we have yet another twist.

Even when you're being "brutally honest" with yourself, there's still that part that wants to look good for being so honest. "Look how self-aware I am about my self-deception" becomes its own form of self-deception.

It's recursive. The ego finds new ways to protect itself even within the process of examining the ego. You think you're dismantling your defences, but you're just building more sophisticated ones.

So this book can't promise to end the game of self-deception. It can only help you play it more consciously. You're going to keep bullshitting yourself, but here's how to catch yourself doing it faster and more often.

That makes the structure more honest too. Not five steps to enlightenment, but five steps to notice the game while you're playing it.

---

## The Framework

I have news for you. It's kind of old news. And it's certainly not so exciting.

Because you see, if you are in conflict, there is a game, and you are a player.

Yes, I know. You know that already.

And the point of the game? Well, again, you know that already. But just for precision—because I like being precise—the point of the game is to end the game.

And you end the game by seeing what the game is about. Because when you see what the game is about, that's what gets you close to freedom. Freedom is the territory you control. The territory where you make the choice to end the game.

The Framework is how you check your own sight. How you can see better.

Five stages: Map it. See it. Judge it. Decide it. Act it.

Tables. Checklists. Templates. The precision of a workbook. And then: art. Images that land before words do. A picture book a child can flip through. A book an academic can cite.

The architecture underneath: a Truth Tester that reveals we can only resolve what we capture—and what we capture is always incomplete. A Living Protocol that breaks every claim on purpose. An Immunity Paradox that explains why we keep failing.

Simple enough for 2am. Rigorous enough for court.

Dense. Raw. Freezing cold in places. *Do this, then that.*

It's based on true events I'm not allowed to write about. Rooted in five years of court expertise—mainly losing, on repeat.

Pure magic, it's not. More like self-inflicted pain.

The pain of doing what's unpleasant. What's difficult. What's honest. The pain of persisting when there's no point. Continuing when there's no hope.

And it's scary. Because it asks you to do exactly that. Surgically.

And it's annoying. Because it claims this is the best of what's possible when everything seems impossible—showing you exactly where one ends and the other begins.

And it is rewarding. But the reward is not a promise of harmony nor peace. It is a promise of precision—a better sight. So you understand *why*. So you know *so what*. So you see *then what*.

And with that, a surprise. A hope inside no hope. A leverage point—no more glass to fight for, only freedom to live for.

Unless you want that cheesy pasta?

---

## The Problem

Well, we have a practical hiccup.

If you're the Honourable Judge Johnson, you can't cite this book. Not in a ruling. Not in chambers. Not at the conference where you speak on family justice reform. "You're Full of Shit" doesn't belong on that slide.

I knew it straight away. The moment I wrote it.

But don't get me wrong. I made that choice with full awareness of its consequences. That choice was needed. There was no other choice. I almost wanted to write that it was the right choice, because you see—I still fall into my own traps.

It doesn't belong not because the framework doesn't deserve to be on that slide. It doesn't belong because the title compromises the framework's value.

The bottom line is: we need you to talk about this framework. Especially if you have the power. Especially if you have a platform. Especially if you are in the position of being truly able to change things in the direction of more peace for all of us.

But even if it's a good framework—and I think it is—if it has a shitty name, no one will use it anyway. It won't spread. It will just sit there. Smart, and silent, and dead. Just words. Unpoked, miserable words on a white sheet of paper.

How do I know this? How can I speak about this with such certainty? Because I know humans. I am human. We all want to look right. We all want to be seen as smart, respectful, professional. And because we all have that imprinted desire to be like that, we can't talk about anything that threatens that projection.

So what do we do? How do we move from this impasse? How do we deal with a hiccup?

At first I thought maybe what I should have done is lie to you. Maybe, ultimately, all of this was a wrong choice. Maybe I should have not let you know how this all works. Maybe I should have not let you know about the right-and-wrong trap. Maybe I should have never written anything about the shit at all. Instead, what I should have done is find a different way. A better way. To make you keep reading. Somehow.

But here's the problem.

Didn't you need to know about the shit?

We all need to know it to have any chance of resolving conflict.

So no. Even though the right does not exist—it was simply the only wise and sensible thing to do, to make you know all of this. (Did you catch me falling into my own trap just now?)

So what do we do now?

Well, if you knew the Framework, you would know exactly what we do. But you don't know it. Not yet. I do. Let me help you.

1. Name
   
2. Check
   
3. Judge
   
4. Decide
   
5. Act

And suddenly it's all simple. We just drop the shit. Because we now know everything we need to know about it. And when you know it, "you are full of shit" is not needed anymore. How can you be in it knowing all of it? You can't.

You know all of this now because you've seen it from inside and you've seen it from outside. You are this betta fish that somehow managed to jump out of the water and got shocked. That fish can no longer be full of shit. That fish can no longer fight the glass. Because that fish realised: there is water and there is out of the water. There is to be in it and there is to be out of it.

And that is how the shit is gone.

And because the shit is gone, the truth can be revealed.

The framework has a name. It always did. The time just wasn't right. Until now.

So now, as we are ready. The time has come—

Here it is.

Ta-da!
