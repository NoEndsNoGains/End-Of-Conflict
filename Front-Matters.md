## Prologue

You're full of shit. So am I. So is everyone ever touched by conflict.

But not all shit is the same. Some we create. Some gets put in us.

Weapon we throw, or wound forced into us—in conflict, we all end up the same: full of it.

And the moment we respond, we either sustain or we resolve. There is no neutral. There is no clean.

Brutal? Yes. Shocking? Yes.

Especially if you're that child who didn't choose. Especially if you're that mother who lost her mind to grief. They didn't pick this. They don't deserve it. And still—chosen or not—the result is the same: now, we are full of it.

In our beautiful human nature, at first, we just get lost. It's too dark, too sticky, too confusing. Shocked and blinded, we panic or freeze. The smell of fear or terror does not allow us to reason.

So we don't. That's not blame. That's not judgment. That is simply how it is. You can't reason when shit drops on you. First, you need time. To shake the shock off. To find your way in.

This book is for the time when shit becomes a bit more bearable. Accustomed. Habituated. For the moment when you realise: regardless of whether the shit was given or chosen—what you do with it is yours.

Oh, imagine if we got there quickly. Wouldn't that be just the best? Because only then—only then—can we change things. Before that, we're just lost.

And, no, no, no. Gaining the reason back does not make it any easier. Perhaps that is where the hard part really starts. And there are so many hard parts.

How about the one where you realise the ones who neither deserved nor chose it might have the biggest chance of ending it? How much wiser are you than those who harmed you? How can you expect that maturity from them? You can't. So it falls to you.

Unfair? Yes. Unacceptable? Yes.

How about the one on "the cleaner story"? Or "it's not my fault"? Or "it's pure genocide"? Or the one on "I'm not in the conflict—I'm just selling the guns." Or "just processing the paperwork." Or "just following procedure." Or "I am here. They are there. Just paying my taxes." Just looking away. Just staying neutral. Just minding your own business.

What—you're not in it? Too polite, too delicate, too posh, too important and too academic for such direct writing? Allow yourself to be right, because you see, this book doesn't let anyone off. The 2am reader isn't just the parent in court. It's the solicitor who filed the documents. The judge who saw the pattern and didn't name it. The policy-maker who designed the system. The voter who tolerates it. The question isn't whether you're in it. It's how. What are you fighting? What are you sustaining? What story are you telling yourself about why your hands are clean?

But hey, who cares? Why even ask. I tell you... Let's just not ask. Shall we talk about weather and how good your dinner was last night? I had cheesy pasta. You?

The only thing is I can't take it any more. I can't pretend I don't know when I know. Like, we think the glass separates us from the conflict. But there is no separation. The tank is bigger than you think. Two kinds of shit in the same water. And I know I am in it and I know you're in it. So full of shit you can't see anything else. Like a fish that knows nothing but water. But in conflict, we are not any fish. We are betta fish. Stunning creatures—iridescent, fins like silk. Put a mirror in the tank and they attack.

<img width="1024" height="1024" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3b8e02e7-1d42-463e-ad8e-224df2bc14d9" />

Who wants to see their own shit? No one. So they flare. Exhaust themselves protecting a story that feels so *true*, so *just*, so *right*. The betta fish fighting glass, believing they fight a real enemy—when it isn't even there. The enemy is not out there. It's in here. And the greatest enemy? The one in you who already knows what to do with the shit. If that helps, I won't admit I know and I won't remind you that you know it too.

Better? Yes. Cosier? Yes.

Unless you are ready? And if you are, this book is written just for you. And you must know that I think you are brave. That you are graceful. That you are wise. And that you are my hero: the one who knows we all carry it. Few of us look at it. Let's make sense out of this and let's find a way out.

This book offers a way out: a system to follow. A possibility of getting closer to the light.

This book won't make you peaceful. It won't make you right. It might not even end your conflict.

What it might do—if you stay with it—is help you see more clearly. Yourself. The others. The mess itself. And if you see more clearly, a path starts to unfold. Not the path. A path. A possibility of what could be.

The End of Conflict Framework is how you check your own sight.

Five stages: Map it. See it. Judge it. Choose it. Do it.

Tables. Checklists. Templates. The precision of a workbook. And then: art. Images that land before words do. A picture book a child can flip through. A book an academic can cite.

The architecture underneath: a Truth Tester that reveals we can only resolve what we capture—and what we capture is always incomplete. A Living Protocol that breaks every claim on purpose. An Immunity Paradox that explains why we keep failing.

Simple enough for 2am. Rigorous enough for court.

Dense. Raw. Freezing cold in places. *Do this, then that.*

It's based on true events I'm not allowed to write about. Rooted in five years of court expertise—mainly losing, on repeat.

Pure magic, it's not. More like self-inflicted pain.

The pain of doing what's unpleasant. What's difficult. What's honest. The pain of persisting when there's no point. Continuing when there's no hope.

And it's scary. Because it asks you to do exactly that. Surgically.

And it's annoying. Because it claims this is the best of what's possible when everything seems impossible—showing you exactly where one ends and the other begins.

And it is rewarding. But the reward is not a promise of harmony nor peace. It is a promise of precision—a better sight. So you understand *why*. So you know *so what*. So you see *then what*.

And with that, a surprise. A hope inside no hope. A leverage point—no more glass to fight for, only freedom to live for.

Unless you want that cheesy pasta?

## THIS IS SO MUCH FUN

**Why This Title?**

Here's why it doesn't quite work at first glance: I'm asking you to "shut up" while leading with something that sounds like I'm picking a fight. It's contradictory messaging—like teaching de-escalation by escalating.

But here's the thing: you're ALL full of shit. Every single person in the conflict has blind spots, self-deceptions, stories they tell themselves. Only some of us are willing to admit it and look at our own bullshit.

That's actually profound. The conflict continues because people are protecting their version of being right instead of acknowledging where they're deceiving themselves. It's not about one person being wrong—it's about everyone carrying some level of self-deception, and the willingness to face that being the key differentiator.

So "You're Full of Shit" isn't an attack—it's an invitation to universal honesty. The people who can hear that and say "yeah, probably" are the ones who can actually end the fight.

That's a sharper insight than most conflict resolution approaches. Most try to be diplomatic about everyone's feelings. I'm saying the real work starts with admitting we're all carrying some level of delusion.

---

**About This Title**

I understand this title might turn you off. It's not the title I would normally choose. I don't even like using this language.

But I don't think there is anything more accurate. More blunt. It has to be blunt.

And let me correct something: this framework is not only about catching your own bullshit. It's about catching everyone's bullshit—including the bullshit of the mess itself. The stories the conflict tells about itself. The narratives that keep the whole thing spinning.

---

**A Note to Those in Power**

Actually, I need you to read this book. I want you to read this book.

Especially if you are in a position of power.

*Especially.*

If you are in a position of power, you might want a different title. A title that satisfies your ego. A smart title. A respectable title. Something you could mention at dinner parties without people looking at you sideways.

Here's my dilemma: even if you are full of bullshit, if I don't tell you that directly, you might actually read this. And if you read it, the chance of the conflict ending increases.

So allow me to lie to you.

Allow me to tell you that I am completely wrong and you are completely right. Does that help you read? I will lie. I will tell you whatever you need to hear to keep turning pages.

Because people in positions of power—the ones who actually decide about conflicts—they like being right. They need to be right. Their entire identity is built on being right. And if being right is what gets them to read, then the ends justify the means. Whatever it takes.

---

**My Own Bullshit**

There is also something about my ego here. You see, I am—even if bad at it—still an academic. I value coherence. Logic. Clarity of thought.

And "You're Full of Shit" is not a very academic title, is it? It doesn't look good on a CV. It doesn't signal the years of research, the careful frameworks, the intellectual rigour I'd like to believe I bring.

So what about a compromise?

What if we start from a different title? A new title on the next page. One that lets you in without making you flinch. One that satisfies your need to feel respected and my need to feel academic.

But know this: behind both doors is the same room. And in that room, we're all full of shit together.

---

**But Who Am I to Tell You?**

And here is my usual twist—how dare I tell you this? Who am I? Who gave me the right?

Especially if you're like that grieving mother who lost her son in Ukraine. Her hearing "you're full of shit" isn't an invitation to self-reflection. It's cruelty.

There's something crucial here about context and power. The universal self-deception insight might still be true, but there are situations where someone's "shit" is grief, trauma, or genuine powerlessness—not ego protection.

But guess what—do you think being victimised or traumatised gives you a forever ticket to do nothing? Guess what happens then? We continue. The conflict continues.

To allow yourself to be in pain, to be shattered, to be resigned—I'm not telling you to have hope when there is no hope. There is a time for everything, and at this moment, it might not be time for you to enter this framework. And I accept that. Simply, it's not the time for you to read this book.

But if you were in those stages of being completely shattered, of being in such pain, you wouldn't be reading this. You are reading it because you are ready.

So even if you are that victim, even if you are that traumatised individual, even if you are that Ukrainian mother who screams with the silence of pain, you still must accept the main hypothesis this book is based on: self-deception is a fundamental human condition. Like saying everyone has a heartbeat. It's not a moral judgment. It's just how consciousness works.

---

**When Is the Right Time?**

You reading this book or putting it back on the shelf will decide, will determine, will show you—when is the right time to examine your own bullshit.

If you read—that time is now.

If you don't—then that's not the time.

It's not time because there's too much pain, too much fear, too much anger, too much... In the time of too much, you might need that self-deception. It's protective self-deception that needs space and allows you to survive.

This book assumes you have enough psychological safety and external stability to look at your own bullshit without it destroying you. If you don't—if you're in active crisis, if you're unsafe, if your basic needs aren't met—you may need care, protection, or justice first. Not this framework. This is not a failure. It's triage.

But if you've got this far in reading, then know: what you're carrying is defensive self-deception that's perpetuating the conflict.

This book isn't telling anyone they're full of shit. It's for people who already suspect they might be and are choosing to look at it.

So this unkind, rude, judgemental phrase—"You are full of shit"—becomes an invitation rather than an accusation. It's saying: if you think you might be full of shit and want to do something about it, here's how.

More than that: looking at your own shit gives you the greatest chance of getting out of conflict. Darwin would call it natural selection based on brutal honesty criteria.

---

**The Trap Within the Trap**

But here we have yet another twist.

Even when you're being "brutally honest" with yourself, there's still that part that wants to look good for being so honest. "Look how self-aware I am about my self-deception" becomes its own form of self-deception.

It's recursive. The ego finds new ways to protect itself even within the process of examining the ego. You think you're dismantling your defences, but you're just building more sophisticated ones.

So this book can't promise to end the game of self-deception. It can only help you play it more consciously. You're going to keep bullshitting yourself, but here's how to catch yourself doing it faster and more often.

That makes the structure more honest too. Not five steps to enlightenment, but five steps to notice the game while you're playing it.

Because, you see, I have news for you: if you are in conflict, there is a game, and you are a player.

**Choose: Being Right or Being Free**

That's what makes it so uncomfortable—most people don't realise they're making that choice. They think they can have both, or they think being right IS being free. But those are often mutually exclusive.

How is that even possible? How come being right is not being free?

Because if someone is right, then someone has to be wrong. If someone is wrong, then there will be resistance, and the conflict will continue.

That's the mechanism. Being right requires a loser. And losers don't go quietly—they resist, they defend, they fight back. So the very act of claiming rightness creates the opposition that traps you.

You can't be free while you're busy making someone else wrong, because now you're locked in a dance with their resistance. You need them to accept being wrong for your rightness to be complete, but they won't. So you're dependent on something you'll never get.

Freedom comes from stepping out of the right/wrong game entirely. Not "I'm right and you're wrong" or even "we're both right"—but dropping the whole framework of needing to be right at all.

That's the real uncomfortable truth of this book. Most people would rather stay in conflict forever than give up being right.

---

**Why Would You Choose This?**

Here's why this is so incredibly hard.

Because it's based on your continuous choice. You might be the only one who chooses to stay. The only one looking at the bullshit. The only one going through the framework. The only one losing.

It's like being continuously slapped in the face and choosing not to slap back.

And it might be that you keep choosing this while the game continues. While somebody else chooses something else entirely. While they keep playing the old way. While the pattern repeats.

Again.

And again.

So then you ask yourself: what's the point? If it doesn't end the conflict, why would I choose this? Why would I keep choosing this?

Here's why.

The framework doesn't promise to end the conflict. It promises something else. It gives you sense-making. It helps you see a little more clearly. It helps you understand. It helps you name what's actually happening.

And that—just that—gets you closer to your freedom.

Not their freedom. Not the end of the game. Not resolution.

Yours.

Your freedom is yours regardless of what they do. That's the only territory you ever controlled anyway.

---

**So Here It Is**

Being right feels so good. Would you like me to tell you this now: Yes, you're right. Yes, you suffered. Yes and yes and yes.

Feels good?

Then continue. You've been here once—or thousands of times before. Humans like repetition, so repeat. Be right. Have it.

This is where the book ends for you. There's no point reading on. Just go back and ask for your money back. I hope you are right. And you are full of shit. Both would be true.

And if you stay... gosh... are you a bit nuts? A bit too desperate? A bit too much in a "cross the line" situation?

Again, right on all accounts.

The only thing is, none of this will help you get through the framework. The framework is hard work. Unbelievably hard work.

For starters, shit smells, and it's certainly not a nice thing to look at. (Isn't that the most academic of my sentences yet?)

But who am I to decide? I have only one job: to write this framework so you can actually go through it.

Let's see how deep my own shit is, how ugly it is, and how bad it smells.

Hey, that should actually be pleasurable for you. Looking at other people's shit might even be fun. And I have plenty of it in copious amounts.

So if everything else fails, this book should at least be entertaining.

*This book will not give you peace. It will not make you right. It will not resolve your conflict.*

*What it might do—if you're ready, if you're honest, if you stay with it—is help you see yourself a little more clearly while you're in the mess. That's all. That's everything.*
