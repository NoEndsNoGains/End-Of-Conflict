## Summary (Back Cover. Reader-Writer Contract):

---

You're full of shit. So am I. So is everyone touched by the conflict, whether they act or just watch.

We all carry it. Few of us look at it.

This book won't make you peaceful. It won't make you right. It might not even end your conflict.

What it might do — if you stay with it — is help you see more clearly. Yourself. The others. The mess itself. And if you see more clearly, a path starts to unfold. Not the path. A path. A possibility of what could be.

Most of us don't see clearly. We're like betta fish — stunning creatures, iridescent, fins like silk. Put a mirror in the tank and they attack. They flare and exhaust themselves against an enemy that isn't there. Fighting glass. Fighting a projection. Not reality.

In conflict, we do the same. We fight our own reflection until we're exhausted. Sometimes until we die.

The End of Conflict Framework is how you check your own sight.

Five stages: Map it. See it. Judge it. Choose it. Do it.

Tables. Checklists. Templates. The precision of a workbook. And then: art. Images that land before words do. A picture book a child can flip through. A book an academic can cite.

The architecture underneath: a Truth Tester that reveals we can only resolve what we capture — and what we capture is always incomplete. A Living Protocol that breaks every claim on purpose. An Immunity Paradox that explains why we keep failing.

Simple enough for 2am. Rigorous enough for court.

Dense. Raw. Freezing cold in places. _Do this, then that._

It's based on true events I'm not allowed to write about. Rooted in five years of court expertise — mainly losing, on repeat.

Pure magic, it's not. More like self-inflicted pain.

The pain of doing what's unpleasant. What's difficult. What's honest. The pain of persisting when there's no point. Continuing when there's no hope.

And it's scary. Because it asks you to do exactly that. Surgically. 

And it's annoying. Because it claims this is the best of what's possible when everything seems impossible — showing you exactly where one ends and the other begins.

And it is rewarding. But the reward is not peace nor a promise of harmony. It is a promise of  precision - a better sight. So you understand _why_. So you know _so what_. So you see _then what_.

And with that, a surprise. A hope inside no hope. A leverage point — no more glass to fight for, only freedom to live for.

## BOOK PROPOSAL INFO (NOT COVERED ANYWHERE ELSE)

### Why now?

We are drowning in conflict we cannot resolve.
Families fracturing through courts that promise justice and deliver exhaustion. Institutions bleeding trust. Democracies splitting into tribes that no longer share facts. Conflicts where parties don't agree on what happened. Where information is weaponised. Where good faith is bad faith. Where shared facts are _mine vs yours_. Where systems meant to resolve disputes instead perpetuate them. Where a mutual desire to stop fighting is you being the only one caring about doing right — not being right.
That's a different game. A game that needs its own framework.
This book is that framework.

### What the book CAN do:

- **The 2am reader:** A framework to hold when everything feels chaotic.
- **The parent in court:** Language for what's happening. A tool to prepare, document, think.
- **The professional:** Something to give clients. A shared structure.
- **The one who gives up:** Permission to stop. Even "no hope" is a wall you built.
- **The academic:** A synthesis. Testable claims. An engine room to critique. A framework to put conflicts through.

### What This Book Cannot Do

- Make a bad actor cooperate
- Fix power imbalances
- Replace courts, therapy, or professional help
- Work without effort
- Promise resolution when resolution isn't possible

### Measurable Difference

**Before the framework:**
- Reacting emotionally to every provocation
- Confusing what happened with what to do about it
- Feeling stuck with no way forward
- Blaming people, not problems
- Exhausting yourself fighting glass

**After the framework:**
- Pausing to map before responding
- Separating reality from decision
- Five stages to work through — progress visible on paper
- Naming what's Violated, Concealed, Ignored
- Knowing which conflicts are real, which are projection

---

### What Success Sounds Like

- **A parent:** "I finally understood what I was actually fighting about."
- **A mediator:** "I gave them the book. They came back with a map."
- **A therapist:** "The framework externalised the conflict. We could work with it."
- **An academic:** "The Immunity Paradox is testable. I'm designing a study."
- **A reader:** "I stopped. The Epilogue gave me permission."
  
## Tracking Impact

The honest answer: there are many metrics that could matter. Many things that could be tracked.

But what's most important is that the framework is used. Tested. Broken.

### What matters:

A failure library. Real conflicts put through the framework. Where it worked. Where it didn't. Where it broke completely. That's the valuable data I am interested in (not even so much for myself but for others).

### What I'm not offering:

Empire.

I'll write it. I'll put it out. I'll invite people to break it.

But I'm not interested in building a business around this framework. If an institution, a research group, or a practitioner network wants to adopt it, test it, scale it — good. That's what it's for.

The framework is the contribution. Owning it was never the point.

## About the author

### Professional background:

**Current role:**
Senior Lecturer in Organisational Behaviour, University of the West of England (UWE Bristol)

**Academic credentials:**
PhD in Leadership (University of Reading)

**Teaching:**
Among many: 
- Organisational culture and change management
- Team Enterpreneurship
- Personal, Professional Development
- Team Coaching

### Connection to this book:

This book emerges from two sources:

**Academic expertise:**
Years of teaching organisational behaviour — how groups conflict, how systems fail, how institutions resist change. The framework draws on decision theory, ethics, epistemology, and conflict studies. The three tests (L.E.R, B.U.S, A.C.T) translate philosophical traditions into practical tools.

**Lived experience:**
I have been the person at 2am. I have navigated family court. I have been the betta fish, flaring at glass. This book is not written from above. It is written from inside.

The combination — academic rigour and personal stakes — is what makes this framework different. It is tested in theory and in life.

### Previously published works:

This is my first book.
I have published some academic work including but with limit so far focusing mainly on teaching. 

### Biography (short):

A Senior Lecturer in Organisational Behaviour at the University of the West of England. She holds a PhD and specialises in leadership, systemic change, institutional design, and organisational learning. Her research examines how systems fail — and how they might be fixed. 

This is her first book. It emerged from years of academic work and from navigating her own hopeless conflict.

She lives in Somerset, United Kingdom, with her family.

## Marketing plan

### What I bring:

| Asset | How it serves the book |
|-------|------------------------|
| University platform | Direct access to students studying organisational behaviour, conflict, change management |
| Academic networks | Connections to researchers, conferences, professional development programmes |
| Professional associations | Relationships with mediators, HR professionals, organisational consultants through teaching and research |
| The concept itself | "Betta fish" is memorable and shareable — designed to spread through word of mouth |

### What I would like to do:

- Change the book to an academic article as a co-laboration with other academics
- Present at academic and professional conferences
- Share with professional networks (mediators, family lawyers, HR)
- Make templates and resources available online to drive discovery
- Collect case studies and reader feedback to build evidence base

### What I won't pretend:

I am not a marketer. I don't have a social media following. I don't have an email list of 1 nor 50,000 subscribers.

I am an academic and a practitioner. I wrote this book because it needed to exist — for the person at 2am who has tried everything, i.e. me.

I am looking for a publisher who believes in the book itself, and who can bring the marketing expertise I don't have energy for. 

The hardest job will be to finish it. And the truth is I never finish anything. 

How is that for a book publication pitch?

PROLOGUE: THIS IS SO MUCH FUN - OR A CHAPTER THAT NOONE EVER READS

**Why This Title?**

Here's why it doesn't quite work at first glance: I'm asking you to "shut up" while leading with something that sounds like I'm picking a fight. It's contradictory messaging—like teaching de-escalation by escalating.

But here's the thing: you're ALL full of shit. Every single person in the conflict has blind spots, self-deceptions, stories they tell themselves. Only some of us are willing to admit it and look at our own bullshit.

That's actually profound. The conflict continues because people are protecting their version of being right instead of acknowledging where they're deceiving themselves. It's not about one person being wrong—it's about everyone carrying some level of self-deception, and the willingness to face that being the key differentiator.

So "You're Full of Shit" isn't an attack—it's an invitation to universal honesty. The people who can hear that and say "yeah, probably" are the ones who can actually end the fight.

That's a sharper insight than most conflict resolution approaches. Most try to be diplomatic about everyone's feelings. I'm saying the real work starts with admitting we're all carrying some level of delusion.

---

**About This Title**

I understand this title might turn you off. It's not the title I would normally choose. I don't even like using this language.

But I don't think there is anything more accurate. More blunt. It has to be blunt.

And let me correct something: this framework is not only about catching your own bullshit. It's about catching everyone's bullshit—including the bullshit of the mess itself. The stories the conflict tells about itself. The narratives that keep the whole thing spinning.

---

**A Note to Those in Power**

Actually, I need you to read this book. I want you to read this book.

Especially if you are in a position of power.

*Especially.*

If you are in a position of power, you might want a different title. A title that satisfies your ego. A smart title. A respectable title. Something you could mention at dinner parties without people looking at you sideways.

Here's my dilemma: even if you are full of bullshit, if I don't tell you that directly, you might actually read this. And if you read it, the chance of the conflict ending increases.

So allow me to lie to you.

Allow me to tell you that I am completely wrong and you are completely right. Does that help you read? I will lie. I will tell you whatever you need to hear to keep turning pages.

Because people in positions of power—the ones who actually decide about conflicts—they like being right. They need to be right. Their entire identity is built on being right. And if being right is what gets them to read, then the ends justify the means. Whatever it takes.

---

**My Own Bullshit**

There is also something about my ego here. You see, I am—even if bad at it—still an academic. I value coherence. Logic. Clarity of thought.

And "You're Full of Shit" is not a very academic title, is it? It doesn't look good on a CV. It doesn't signal the years of research, the careful frameworks, the intellectual rigour I'd like to believe I bring.

So what about a compromise?

What if we start from a different title? A new title on the next page. One that lets you in without making you flinch. One that satisfies your need to feel respected and my need to feel academic.

But know this: behind both doors is the same room. And in that room, we're all full of shit together.

---

**This Book Is Me**

I have all the credentials to write it. I spent five years in court. Mainly losing.

I know something about conflict, then.

Based on true events. But true events I have to lie about, because I am not allowed to write about them. So I will lie. I will not tell you what the truth is.

Still, this book is based on true events.

And because it's me. And because I don't like lying. And it's not something I'm choosing to practise.

This book is a representation of exactly who I am: childishness meets sophistication. Juxtaposition meets flow.

I'm doing it because I am tired of pretending. Tired of delivering something that does not represent who I am. Just because that's what somebody else wants.

What I want most is truth.

And truth is who I am.

It's that book.

---

**But Who Am I to Tell You?**

And here is my usual twist—how dare I tell you this? Who am I? Who gave me the right?

Especially if you're like that grieving mother who lost her son in Ukraine. Her hearing "you're full of shit" isn't an invitation to self-reflection. It's cruelty.

There's something crucial here about context and power. The universal self-deception insight might still be true, but there are situations where someone's "shit" is grief, trauma, or genuine powerlessness—not ego protection.

But guess what—do you think being victimised or traumatised gives you a forever ticket to do nothing? Guess what happens then? We continue. The conflict continues.

To allow yourself to be in pain, to be shattered, to be resigned—I'm not telling you to have hope when there is no hope. There is a time for everything, and at this moment, it might not be time for you to enter this framework. And I accept that. Simply, it's not the time for you to read this book.

But if you were in those stages of being completely shattered, of being in such pain, you wouldn't be reading this. You are reading it because you are ready.

So even if you are that victim, even if you are that traumatised individual, even if you are that Ukrainian mother who screams with the silence of pain, you still must accept the main hypothesis this book is based on: self-deception is a fundamental human condition. Like saying everyone has a heartbeat. It's not a moral judgment. It's just how consciousness works.

---

**When Is the Right Time?**

You reading this book or putting it back on the shelf will decide, will determine, will show you—when is the right time to examine your own bullshit.

If you read—that time is now.

If you don't—then that's not the time.

It's not time because there's too much pain, too much fear, too much anger, too much... In the time of too much, you might need that self-deception. It's protective self-deception that needs space and allows you to survive.

This book assumes you have enough psychological safety and external stability to look at your own bullshit without it destroying you. If you don't—if you're in active crisis, if you're unsafe, if your basic needs aren't met—you may need care, protection, or justice first. Not this framework. This is not a failure. It's triage.

But if you've got this far in reading, then know: what you're carrying is defensive self-deception that's perpetuating the conflict.

This book isn't telling anyone they're full of shit. It's for people who already suspect they might be and are choosing to look at it.

So this unkind, rude, judgemental phrase—"You are full of shit"—becomes an invitation rather than an accusation. It's saying: if you think you might be full of shit and want to do something about it, here's how.

More than that: looking at your own shit gives you the greatest chance of getting out of conflict. Darwin would call it natural selection based on brutal honesty criteria.

---

**The Trap Within the Trap**

But here we have yet another twist.

Even when you're being "brutally honest" with yourself, there's still that part that wants to look good for being so honest. "Look how self-aware I am about my self-deception" becomes its own form of self-deception.

It's recursive. The ego finds new ways to protect itself even within the process of examining the ego. You think you're dismantling your defences, but you're just building more sophisticated ones.

So this book can't promise to end the game of self-deception. It can only help you play it more consciously. You're going to keep bullshitting yourself, but here's how to catch yourself doing it faster and more often.

That makes the structure more honest too. Not five steps to enlightenment, but five steps to notice the game while you're playing it.

Because, you see, I have news for you: if you are in conflict, there is a game, and you are a player.

---

**The Betta Fish**

Betta fish attack when they see themselves in the mirror or see another betta. They're literally fighting their own image.

We, you, I—aren't we all like that? All at once?

A bit like the betta fish.

Stunning creature. Iridescent. Fins like silk. Put a mirror in the tank and it attacks. Flares and exhausts itself against an enemy that isn't there. It's fighting a projection. Not reality.

It can do this until it dies.

In conflict, we're betta fish. Fighting our own reflection. Exhausting ourselves against glass.

This book won't make you peaceful. Some conflicts are real. Some enemies aren't reflections.

But most of the time? We're attacking the mirror.

This framework is how you check.

Stop fighting the glass. Instead, just look at yourself. It's you. A beautiful, traumatised, tragic you—you, full of your own shit. You don't want to look. You don't look. Because comfort is where we stay stuck in our bullshit.

I drew a picture for you so you can see yourself a bit better.

And if you've had enough... well?

That's the guiding principle: truth over comfort. Whatever level of disruption actually moves someone toward seeing their own patterns more clearly.

<img width="1024" height="1024" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3b8e02e7-1d42-463e-ad8e-224df2bc14d9" />

**The Hardest Test**

In Gaza, you'd have layers of self-deception operating simultaneously: individual stories people tell themselves to survive, collective narratives that justify actions, political stories that maintain power structures. But you'd also have genuine trauma, real powerlessness, and structural oppression.

Let me be clear: structural injustice is real. Power asymmetries are real. When a state bombs civilians, when systems grind people down, when violence is one-sided—that's not projection. That's not mirror-fighting. I'm not asking you to pretend oppression is a mindset problem.

What I am asking is different and more modest: given the structural reality you cannot currently change, what stories are you telling yourself about what's possible? Are those stories serving your survival, or are they foreclosing options you haven't yet seen?

That's not the same as saying "both sides." It's saying: even when one side holds the guns, you still get to examine what's happening in your own mind. Not because it's fair. Because it's the only territory you actually control.

Maybe the question isn't whether people in Gaza are "full of shit." Maybe it's about which stories serve survival versus which ones perpetuate the cycle. Some self-deception might be psychologically necessary for people under siege, while other narratives keep the conflict locked in place.

This is exactly what makes people squirm. The idea that even in the most extreme suffering, there might still be elements of self-deception mixed in with legitimate grievance and trauma.

This framework does the impossible—it risks adding to your load. Adding more harm to people already carrying unbearable weight. They're already so broken, so hungry, and now they must admit to their own "shit"?

But if the ultimate goal is ending the conflict, then every story that perpetuates it becomes fair game to examine, no matter how justified it feels.

I'm not talking about who's responsible for ending wars or dismantling systems. That's macro-responsibility, and it's distributed according to power. The people with the most power have the most responsibility to change the structure.

I'm talking about micro-agency: the small territory of your own perception, your own reactions, your own stories. That's what this framework addresses. Not because it's sufficient—it isn't—but because it's yours.

So even in Gaza, there might be stories on all sides that serve emotional needs but prevent resolution. "They'll never change." "This is who they are." "We have no choice." Narratives that might feel true but actually close off possibilities for different outcomes.

The brutal question becomes: are you more attached to your story about why the conflict continues, or to actually ending it? Even when your story contains real truth about injustice and suffering?

That's where it gets maximally uncomfortable—asking people to examine whether their most cherished beliefs about their situation might be part of what keeps them trapped in it. Not dismissing the reality of their experience, but questioning which parts of their interpretation serve freedom versus which parts serve the continuation of the pattern.

---

**Choose: Being Right or Being Free**

That's what makes it so uncomfortable—most people don't realise they're making that choice. They think they can have both, or they think being right IS being free. But those are often mutually exclusive.

How is that even possible? How come being right is not being free?

Because if someone is right, then someone has to be wrong. If someone is wrong, then there will be resistance, and the conflict will continue.

That's the mechanism. Being right requires a loser. And losers don't go quietly—they resist, they defend, they fight back. So the very act of claiming rightness creates the opposition that traps you.

You can't be free while you're busy making someone else wrong, because now you're locked in a dance with their resistance. You need them to accept being wrong for your rightness to be complete, but they won't. So you're dependent on something you'll never get.

Freedom comes from stepping out of the right/wrong game entirely. Not "I'm right and you're wrong" or even "we're both right"—but dropping the whole framework of needing to be right at all.

That's the real uncomfortable truth of this book. Most people would rather stay in conflict forever than give up being right.

---

**Why Would You Choose This?**

Here's why this is so incredibly hard.

Because it's based on your continuous choice. You might be the only one who chooses to stay. The only one looking at the bullshit. The only one going through the framework. The only one losing.

It's like being continuously slapped in the face and choosing not to slap back.

And it might be that you keep choosing this while the game continues. While somebody else chooses something else entirely. While they keep playing the old way. While the pattern repeats.

Again.

And again.

So then you ask yourself: what's the point? If it doesn't end the conflict, why would I choose this? Why would I keep choosing this?

Here's why.

The framework doesn't promise to end the conflict. It promises something else. It gives you sense-making. It helps you see a little more clearly. It helps you understand. It helps you name what's actually happening.

And that—just that—gets you closer to your freedom.

Not their freedom. Not the end of the game. Not resolution.

Yours.

Your freedom is yours regardless of what they do. That's the only territory you ever controlled anyway.

---

**So Here It Is**

Being right feels so good. Would you like me to tell you this now: Yes, you're right. Yes, you suffered. Yes and yes and yes.

Feels good?

Then continue. You've been here once—or thousands of times before. Humans like repetition, so repeat. Be right. Have it.

This is where the book ends for you. There's no point reading on. Just go back and ask for your money back. I hope you are right. And you are full of shit. Both would be true.

And if you stay... gosh... are you a bit nuts? A bit too desperate? A bit too much in a "cross the line" situation?

Again, right on all accounts.

The only thing is, none of this will help you get through the framework. The framework is hard work. Unbelievably hard work.

For starters, shit smells, and it's certainly not a nice thing to look at. (Isn't that the most academic of my sentences yet?)

But who am I to decide? I have only one job: to write this framework so you can actually go through it.

Let's see how deep my own shit is, how ugly it is, and how bad it smells.

Hey, that should actually be pleasurable for you. Looking at other people's shit might even be fun. And I have plenty of it in copious amounts.

So if everything else fails, this book should at least be entertaining.

*This book will not give you peace. It will not make you right. It will not resolve your conflict.*

*What it might do—if you're ready, if you're honest, if you stay with it—is help you see yourself a little more clearly while you're in the mess. That's all. That's everything.*
