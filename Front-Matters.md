## A Five-Stage Framework to End Hopeless Conflict

You're Full of Shit: Five Steps to Shut Up and End the Fight

## Summary (Back Cover):

You're fighting glass. Here's how to check.

Tables. Checklists. Templates. The precision of a workbook.
And then: art. Images that land before words do. A picture book a child can flip through. A book an academic can cite.

Most conflicts persist not because they're unsolvable — but because we skip the steps resolution requires. We don't name them clearly. We assume instead of verify. We judge people before consequences. We confuse the verdict with the sentence. We talk without acting.

This isn't another call for empathy or communication. It's a diagnostic tool — a cold mechanism to see conflict structurally, outside our emotional reaction.

Five stages: Map it. See it. Judge it. Choose it. Do it.

Underneath: a Truth Tester that reveals we can only resolve what we capture — and what we capture is always incomplete. A Living Protocol that breaks every claim on purpose. An Immunity Paradox that explains why we keep failing.

Simple enough for 2am. Rigorous enough for court.

It doesn't promise magic. It promises the best of what's possible — and shows you exactly where that boundary lies.

---

## Why now?

We are drowning in conflict we cannot resolve. Families fracturing through courts that promise justice and deliver exhaustion. Institutions haemorrhaging trust. Democracies polarising into tribes that no longer share facts.

Most conflict resolution assumes good faith, shared facts, and a mutual desire to stop fighting. Those assumptions are increasingly naive.

This book is built for harder reality — confused, layered, unjust. Conflicts where parties don't agree on what happened, where information is weaponised, where systems meant to resolve disputes instead perpetuate them.

It doesn't promise harmony. It promises precision — and shows you exactly where that precision breaks down.


**What's actually unique:**

| Contribution | What's new |
|--------------|------------|
| The betta fish diagnosis | Most conflict is against projections, not enemies |
| The five stages | A sequence that forces precision: Map → Reality → Judgment → Decision → Action |
| Consequences before people | Judge Violated, Concealed, Ignored — before assigning blame |
| The three tests | L.E.R (Right), B.U.S (Wise), A.C.T (Doable) — philosophy made practical |
| The engine room | Truth Tester, Living Research Protocol, Immunity Paradox — the theory underneath |
| The format | Picture book meets workbook. Art and checklists. Child and academic. |
| The honesty | Shows you where resolution is impossible, not just hard |


## What can this book achieve?

### What the book CAN do:

| For whom | Impact |
|----------|--------|
| The person at 2am | A framework to hold when everything feels chaotic. A way to see clearly when emotions won't let you. |
| The parent in court | Language for what's happening. A tool to prepare, document, think. |
| The professional (mediator, lawyer, therapist) | Something to give clients. A shared structure. A way to say "let's map this first." |
| The reader who gives up | Permission to stop. The Epilogue says: even "no hope" is a wall you built. That's enough. |
| The academic | A synthesis. Testable claims. The engine room to critique or build on. |

### What the book CANNOT do:

- Make a bad actor cooperate
- Fix power imbalances
- Replace courts, therapy, or professional help
- Work without effort
- Promise resolution when resolution isn't possible

### Honest impact:

Most books sell few copies.
Some become tools. "Betta fish" becomes shorthand. A mediator asks: "Is that an enemy — or glass?"
One person uses it. Passes it on.
That's most realistic impact this book can produce.


## Measurable difference

### For readers:

| Before | After | Measurable change |
|--------|-------|-------------------|
| Reacting emotionally to every provocation | Pausing to map before responding | Fewer escalations. Documented in journal or correspondence. |
| Confusing what happened with what to do about it | Separating Reality from Decision | Clearer court statements. Less rambling. |
| Feeling stuck with no way forward | Five stages to work through | Completion of each stage = progress visible on paper. |
| Blaming the person, not the problem | Naming Violated, Concealed, Ignored | Language shifts from "he's evil" to "trust was broken." |
| Exhausting themselves fighting glass | Checking: mirror or enemy? | Able to name which conflicts are real, which are projection. |

### For organisations:

| Before | After | Measurable change |
|--------|-------|-------------------|
| Disputes escalate to HR or legal | Teams map conflict first | Fewer formal complaints. Earlier resolution. |
| Meetings rehash the same fights | Framework identifies Structural vs Operational | Time saved. Root cause addressed. |
| Blame culture | Consequences-before-people approach | Language shifts. Accountability without vilification. |

**Concrete example — organisation:**
A team in conflict uses the framework in a facilitated session. They discover the surface dispute (operational) masks a structural question: who has authority to decide? Resolving the structural issue stops the recurring fights. Meeting time drops. Turnover decreases.

### For communities:

| Before | After | Measurable change |
|--------|-------|-------------------|
| Polarised groups talking past each other | Shared framework for mapping disagreement | Common language. Possibility of dialogue. |
| Mediators improvising | Consistent five-stage structure | Training standardised. Outcomes comparable. |
| Courts overwhelmed with intractable disputes | Parties arrive with mapped conflicts | Faster hearings. Clearer issues. Less court time. |

**Concrete example — community:**
A mediation service adopts the framework. Mediators report clients arrive better prepared. Average sessions drop from 4 to 3. Resolution rates increase by 15%. "Betta fish" becomes shorthand: "Are you sure that's an enemy?"

### What success looks like:

- A parent says: "I finally understood what I was actually fighting about."
- A mediator says: "I gave them the book. They came back with a map."
- A therapist says: "The framework externalised the conflict. We could work with it."
- An academic says: "The Immunity Paradox is testable. I'm designing a study."
- A reader says: "I stopped. The Epilogue gave me permission."

## About the author

### Professional background:

**Current role:**
Senior Lecturer in Organisational Behaviour, University of the West of England (UWE Bristol)

**Academic credentials:**
PhD in [your field]

**Teaching:**
- Organisational culture and change management
- [Other relevant courses]

**Research focus:**
- Systemic change in institutional settings
- Transparency and accountability in institutional systems
- Organisational learning and design failures

### Connection to this book:

This book emerges from two sources:

**Academic expertise:**
Years of teaching organisational behaviour — how groups conflict, how systems fail, how institutions resist change. The framework draws on decision theory, ethics, epistemology, and conflict studies. The three tests (L.E.R, B.U.S, A.C.T) translate philosophical traditions into practical tools.

**Lived experience:**
I have been the person at 2am. I have navigated family court. I have been the betta fish, flaring at glass. This book is not written from above. It is written from inside.

The combination — academic rigour and personal stakes — is what makes this framework different. It is tested in theory and in life.

### Previously published works:

This is my first book.

I have published academic work including:
- [Any journal articles, conference papers, reports — list if applicable]
- [Teaching materials, case studies developed]

### What I bring instead of a backlist:

| Asset | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Academic platform | Access to students, practitioners, professional networks |
| Teaching experience | Years of explaining complex ideas simply |
| Professional associations | Connections to mediators, HR professionals, organisational consultants |
| Lived expertise | The framework is battle-tested, not theoretical |
| The Living Research Protocol | Original methodology — already published on GitHub, open for collaboration |

### Biography (short):

[Your name] is a Senior Lecturer in Organisational Behaviour at the University of the West of England. She holds a PhD and specialises in systemic change, institutional design, and organisational learning. Her research examines how systems fail — and how they might be fixed. 

This is her first book. It emerged from years of academic work and from navigating her own hopeless conflict. She wrote it for the person she was: exhausted, stuck, needing a tool that was both rigorous and human.

She lives in Somerset, United Kingdom with her family.


## Competitive titles

## Marketing plan

### What I bring:

| Asset | How it serves the book |
|-------|------------------------|
| University platform | Direct access to students studying organisational behaviour, conflict, change management |
| Academic networks | Connections to researchers, conferences, professional development programmes |
| Professional associations | Relationships with mediators, HR professionals, organisational consultants through teaching and research |
| The concept itself | "Betta fish" is memorable and shareable — designed to spread through word of mouth |

### What I will do:

- Assign the book in my courses
- Present at academic and professional conferences
- Share with professional networks (mediators, family lawyers, HR)
- Make templates and resources available online to drive discovery
- Collect case studies and reader feedback to build evidence base

### What I won't pretend:

I am not a marketer. I don't have a social media following. I don't have an email list of 50,000 subscribers.

I am an academic and a practitioner. I wrote this book because it needed to exist — for the person at 2am who has tried everything.

I am looking for a publisher who believes in the book itself, and who can bring the marketing expertise I lack. I will show up. I will do the work. But I need a partner, not a platform to perform on.

### Why this book can still succeed:

Some books sell because of the author's reach.
Some books sell because they fill a gap nothing else fills.

This is the second kind.

The market for conflict resolution is growing. The books that exist assume good faith, focus on communication, and offer no diagnostic framework. This book is different — and different spreads, even without a megaphone.
