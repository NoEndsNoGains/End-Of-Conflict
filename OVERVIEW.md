# End of Conflict Cheat Sheet
## _"Let me be Dry"_




## 1.1 What Is the End of Conflict Framework?

A systematic five-stage process for seeing conflicts that seem intractable clearly enough to know what to do about them. It applies to disputes between people, groups, or institutions, and to internal dilemmas within one person (modelled as competing "parties"). The framework demands precision at each stage—separating *what happened* from *what it means* from *what to do about it*. This makes solvable problems tractable. It makes unsolvable ones nameable. Both are progress.

---

## 1.2 What Is Its Purpose?

To see the conflict precisely. The framework promises sight—not resolution. Sight is the vehicle. Resolution, exit, clarity that this cannot be resolved, or conviction that this fight must continue—these are possible destinations. What happens next depends on you. The framework doesn't guarantee how it ends—only that blindness won't be why it continued.

Why "End of Conflict" if some conflicts must last? Because something always ends: the confusion, the reactivity, the self-deception. "End" here means the cessation of fog—not necessarily the cessation of the fight. Some conflicts should continue. But they should continue with sight, not blindness. That's the end the framework delivers.

Sight is leverage to end conflict in a way that is:

- **Fair** (L.E.R: Legal, Ethical, Relational)
- **Wise** (B.U.S: Beneficial, Unintended consequences considered, Sustainable)
- **Doable** (A.C.T: Achievable, Clear, Timely)

Not purely win-win—B.U.S accepts necessary losses. Not purely rights-based—L.E.R includes relationships, not just entitlements. Not purely idealistic—A.C.T demands what's actually achievable.

The framework gives you a place to stand. Even when the outcome is uncertain, you know where you are in the process. You know what step comes next. That is its own kind of control—not over what happens, but over how you move through it.

---

## 1.3 Crucial Clarification: Purpose vs Side Effects

The framework's purpose isn't advocacy. It's not a better argument. It's not a sharper sword (that is what lawyers do—they serve what their client wants).

It's not about getting the results you want. It's about what the conflict needs from you. You don't wield the framework; you serve its process. But the process serves you back—what you gain is sight, and sight is the only power no one can take from you.

The fact that you'll become more effective at articulating your position is a side effect of seeing clearly—not the goal.

- Advocacy assumes your position is correct and seeks to persuade others
- The framework assumes all positions might be wrong and seeks to find out what is wrong (substance—e.g. the claim, the motive, the assumption) and where it sits (location—e.g. in you, in them, in the system)

Someone using it as an advocacy tool has already decided the verdict before doing the work. They are not using the framework. They are manipulating it.

The framework rests on a different principle: _I don't have to agree with you to understand you._ Sight without endorsement.

---

## 1.4 Why Is It Needed?

Conflicts persist not because they're unsolvable, but because resolution is desired less than power, revenge, or righteousness. This allows us to skip the steps resolution requires: we don't name clearly (we're inside it), we assume instead of verify (checking threatens identity), we judge people instead of consequences (roles feel fixed), we confuse verdict with solution (acting would transform us), and we choose blindness over action (seeing creates responsibility).

The framework externalises what we cannot do intuitively. It addresses five failures of sight:

- **We can't see**—we're inside it, too threatened. The framework reveals.
- **We see but can't release**—the injustice is real, unaddressed. The framework shows what must be addressed before letting go is possible.
- **We see and like it**—the conflict gives us identity, purpose, an enemy. The framework exposes what we're getting from the war.
- **We see but don't know what to do**—paralysis, overwhelm. The framework sequences: this, then this, then this.
- **We see and the conflict is right**—this fight is protection, not pathology. The framework confirms the stakes.

Not all conflicts should end. Sometimes the conflict is not dysfunction. It's the last dignity. The only lever. The necessary cost of not accepting what should never be accepted:

- Protection from abuse—the conflict IS the boundary
- Resistance to oppression—the fight is the integrity
- Pursuit of justice—the conflict is the only path to truth
- Defence of the vulnerable—until safe, there is no peace
- Refusal to comply with wrong—the conflict is the moral act

The framework helps you see: *Is this one of those?* And if yes—fight clearly, not reactively. Know why you're in it. Know what you're protecting. Know the cost and choose it anyway.

The framework doesn't assume peace. It assumes sight.

---

## 1.5 How Does It Work?

The framework is a mirror you serve; what it reflects is sight; sight is power; power is yours.

Repeated honest engagement with the framework tends to break what can't survive scrutiny. The framework doesn't do this to you. You do it to yourself, using the framework as the mirror. The mechanism:

- **Exhaustion**—Lies require energy. Truth doesn't. Honesty repeated long enough exhausts what isn't true.
- **Absurdity**—You see the fight was bigger than the thing.
- **Collapse**—The "why" evaporates under inspection.
- **Trick**—You catch the gap between what you claim and what you want.
- **Paradox**—In internal conflicts, both sides are you. In external conflicts, you find yourself in them—and them in you. Either way, the enemy becomes harder to locate.

This breaking is not guaranteed. But it is common. And when it happens, something ends—even if the conflict continues.

---

## 1.6 When To Use It?

Not every frustration is a conflict. Traffic cannot negotiate. Before using this framework, confirm the situation qualifies.

**Use when:**

1. There are at least two positions in genuine disagreement (even if they are in you only)
2. You have access to *some* data from all sides—or can mark what you're missing
3. You are willing to *try* to be honest, objective, and unbiased—or at least to notice when you're not

> Regarding point 3: Trying is enough; perfection isn't required. The framework doesn't care if you fail. It cares if you don't try.

> **Note on the dead and the past:**
> The great grandmother is dead. The great grandfather is dead. But the conflict happened, the data exists, and you are alive. The framework serves the living, even when it examines the dead.

> **Note on Incomplete Data:**
> "Access to data from all sides" is ideal, not binary. You rarely have complete access. You always have some access: what they said, what they did, what is documented, what others observed, what you can reasonably infer.
>
> Run the framework with what you have. Mark what you're missing. Bloodhound's job includes mapping the gaps—not just checking claims, but noting: this I cannot verify. This I am inferring. This I do not know.
>
> Incomplete data doesn't stop the framework. It constrains your confidence. Owl judges on available evidence. Lion decides with acknowledged uncertainty. This is not failure—it is honesty about operating conditions.
>
> *(The five stages use animal archetypes—Eagle, Bloodhound, Owl, Lion, Ant—explained below)*

---

## 1.7 What Does the Framework Require?

The previous section asked whether the *situation* qualifies. This section asks whether *you* do.

The framework is a tool. It requires willingness, self-awareness, the ability to distance yourself from your own position, and a genuine desire for conflict to end well.

> If you'd rather fall off the bridge than let the other goat pass—the tool isn't broken. You're just a goat. The framework is not for goats. Baaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa.

![Two goats on a bridge](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/59c02a26-c24a-4aa8-99b4-bed4bc0d385a)

> **Note on Goats:**
> The goat metaphor is about refusal, not incapacity.
>
> Some people won't use the framework because they prefer the fight—the righteousness, the identity, the familiar war. They could step back. They choose not to. Those are goats.
>
> Some people can't. Trauma, danger, survival mode, no psychological safety. Distancing would cost more than staying blind. These are not goats. These are people for whom the framework is not yet safe or possible.
>
> The goat chooses the bridge. The trapped can only choose nothing. Know which you are.

---

## 1.8 Where Do You Start?

**Locate yourself.** Before you map the conflict, you map your position relative to it.

Two dimensions set your coordinates: **position** (your relationship to the conflict—and therefore your blind spots) and **time** (when the conflict is—and therefore what evidence exists).

### a) Position — your relationship to the conflict

- **External:**
  - **Observer** (no power, no output, no stake—purely private learning)
  - **Party** (any power, any output, or any stake)
    - *Direct:* You are a disputant.
    - *Indirect:* You are connected—advisor, witness, decision-maker, or affected bystander.

- **Internal:** The conflict is within yourself. You are analyst, all parties, and battlefield at once.

> **Note on Observer:**
> True Observer is rare. It requires no power to affect the outcome (even indirectly), no output (even conversation), and no stake. If you pay taxes, vote, speak, share, or belong to any system connected to the conflict—you're likely a Party. When in doubt, assume Party. Observer must be proven, not assumed.
>
> Observer is listed for completeness. If you truly have no stake, the framework becomes an intellectual exercise. Most readers are Parties, whether they admit it or not.

> **Note on Internal:**
> In internal conflicts, you are always a Party—you have power, output, and stake in your own mind. But you also have the capacity to observe yourself: to watch your thoughts, notice your impulses, witness your competing forces. This observer-capacity is not the same as the framework's Observer position. You're not neutral. You're not without stake. You're a Party who can also watch.
>
> To use the framework internally: externalise. Name the forces. Give them voices. Make them argue. Then run them through the stages as if they were strangers.
>
> The framework applies to both external and internal conflicts. This section focuses on external conflict for clarity. Internal application follows the same principles but requires additional scaffolding—how to identify the parties within yourself, how to prevent the analyst from being captured by one of them. That work exists. It is not detailed here.
>
> And remember: internal conflicts rarely stay internal. Identify who else is affected.

### b) Time — when the conflict is

- **Past** — Already happened. Memory, documents, evidence. You know how it ended. Your task is still to see—to see clearly what occurred. Then, if needed: to make sense of it, to release what you're carrying, or to seek justice where it was denied.

- **Present** — Happening now. Real events, real claims, real parties. You can see, judge, decide, and act.

- **Future** — Has not played out yet. Projections, assumptions, scenarios. Your map is a hypothesis. Simulation is preparation, not resolution.

***Before you map the conflict, you map your position relative to it.***

## 1.9 What Are the Five Stages in the End of Conflict Framework?

Five stages:

- **MAP:** observation
- **CHECK:** verification
- **JUDGE:** judgment
- **DECIDE:** strategy
- **ACT:** execution

The framework uses five archetypes—cognitive shortcuts that bypass emotional noise. Two lenses, same logic, different door:

- **Eagle → MAP** (Symptoms)
- **Bloodhound → CHECK** (Tests)
- **Owl → JUDGE** (Diagnosis)
- **Lion → DECIDE** (Treatment)
- **Ant → ACT** (Recovery)

Animals make you the agent. Medical makes you the analyst. Pick your door.

---

### The Zoological Chain

- **MAP — Eagle** — *The Vigilant Spotter.* Sees the entire territory from high above: big picture, friction points, and all players—including those invisible to others.

- **CHECK — Bloodhound** — *The Thorough Detective.* Sniffs out the truth by comparing what was said versus what was done to reveal hidden motives, true desires, and what is really wanted.

- **JUDGE — Owl** — *The Wise Judge.* Evaluates what was violated, concealed, or ignored—and delivers the verdict on what must be addressed and what must not.

- **DECIDE — Lion** — *The Strategic Leader.* Circles back to what Eagle saw, now armed with Owl's verdict, and decides the full solution to the problem at its root—even if only part of that solution is yours to execute.

- **ACT — Ant** — *The Diligent Doer.* Carries out the portion of the solution within your control.

> Eagle sees the problem → Bloodhound verifies the details → Owl judges what it means → Lion decides the solution → Ant executes what's yours to do.

---

### The Clinical Chain

- **MAP — Symptoms** — The presenting problem.
- **CHECK — Tests** — The investigation.
- **JUDGE — Diagnosis** — What's actually wrong.
- **DECIDE — Treatment** — The full treatment plan, targeting the underlying condition the diagnosis revealed.
- **ACT — Recovery** — Following through on your part until healed.

> You can't test without symptoms.
> You can't diagnose without tests.
> You can't treat what you haven't diagnosed.
> You can't recover without following the treatment.

> **Note on Accessible vs. Inaccessible Conditions:**
> Diagnosis may reveal causes you cannot treat: another person's defences, systemic inequities, historical wounds. This is not failure—it is accurate mapping.
>
> Lion decides the full solution—all of it. The solution exists whether or not you can execute it alone. But Ant operates only on your micro-agency: your perception, your reactions, your choices—the portion of the problem within your control.
>
> You cannot act on what you do not control. You can act on your response to it.
>
> The framework's promise holds: you will see clearly. What you do with that sight depends on what is actually accessible to you. Sometimes the clearest sight reveals: this part is not mine to fix. That knowledge is still power. Knowing what's not yours to fix frees you to fix what is.

---

> **Note on Zoological vs. Medical:**
> Animals make you the agent; medical makes you the analyst. Both lead to action—but from different positions.
>
> With animals, you *become*: I am the Eagle. I am the Bloodhound. You step into the role.
>
> With medical, you *observe*: I see symptoms. I run tests. You stand outside the process.
>
> The cheat sheet uses animals—because the medical metaphor, although helpful, lets you stay yourself, and the framework argues that's exactly what has to change.



## 1.10 The Diagnostic Questions

**EAGLE — MAPs**

**Eagle Maps all that is There**

*Because you can't solve what you haven't named.*

- What's the conflict?
- Where are the friction points?
- Who are the parties?
- Who is visible?
- Who is hiding?

*Because the hidden often tells more than the seen — with some exceptions.*
(Usually there's a hidden player or a hidden layer. Rarely there's neither.)

>**Note:** Eagle asks: Is this fight about *what* — or about *who decides*?
>
> About what (the fish, the oil). About who decides (the fishing rights, the drilling rights). If it keeps returning — who decides was never settled, or isn't respected.
>
> What Eagle sees can be misleading. That's why Eagle reports to Bloodhound.
---

**BLOODHOUND — CHECKs**

**Bloodhound Checks what Eagle Maps**

*Because what is seen isn't always what's true.*

- What do they say? What do I say?
- What do they do? What do I do?
- What do they want? What do I want?
- What are they hiding? What am I hiding?
- What are they missing? What am I missing?
- What don't they want to see? What don't I want to see?

*Because we all Say, Do, Want, Hide, and Miss and Avoid — no exception.*

> **Note:** Bloodhound's sniff is descriptive. Owl's judgment is evaluative.
>
> The "I" questions are Bloodhound checking Bloodhound.
>
> Bloodhound passes data to Owl.

---

**OWL — JUDGEs**

**Owl Judges what Bloodhound Reports**

*Because truth needs a verdict to not be just information.*

- Is there anything to judge?
- What was violated? (broken — rules, agreements, trust)
- What was concealed? (hidden — facts, motives, truth)
- What was ignored? (missed — needs, fears, losses)
- Who must pay for what?
- What is nothing to be paid for?

*Focus is not on people. Focus is on consequences.*

*Because the verdict is Guilty — or Informed. Sometimes one. Sometimes both. Saddest when neither.*

> **Note:** Judgment asks: What are the consequences of what Bloodhound checked?
>
> No consequence — no verdict. Only information. Sometimes only ignorance. Either way, a problem might still remain.
>
> Owl checks Owl: What do I say, do, want, hide, miss — or don't want to see?
>
> Owl delivers verdict to Lion.
---

**LION — DECIDEs**

**Lion Decides on what Eagle Saw**

*Because a verdict isn't a solution to a problem that remains.*

- How do we resolve this so it doesn't return?

*Because a solution is "never again" — not "here we go again."*

> **Note:** Judgment (Owl) is backward — what happened, what it cost. Decision (Lion) is forward — what to do about the problem. 
>
> Owl may find no one did wrong. Lion still has a problem to solve.
>
> Lion asks: Does what I decide pass?
> - **L.E.R** — Is it right? (Legal, Ethical, Relational)
> - **B.U.S** — Is it wise? (Beneficial, Unintended consequences, Sustainable)
> - **A.C.T** — Is it doable? (Achievable, Clear, Timely)
>
> Fails any test — not a solution. A time bomb.
>
> Lion checks Lion: What do I say, do, want, hide, miss — or don't want to see?
>
> Lion gives orders to Ant.

---

**ANT — ACTs**

**Ant Acts on what Lion Decides**

*Because to decide demands the act.*

- What must I stop doing?
- What must I start doing?
- What must I continue doing?

*Because to act is not just once — it's all the time.*

> **Note:** Ant checks Ant: What do I say, do, want, hide, miss — or don't want to see?
>
> Ant acts. What Ant does becomes what Eagle sees next.
---

## Where Do I Start When I already Started?

MAP. Start there.

You cannot check what you haven't mapped. You cannot judge what you haven't checked. You cannot decide what you haven't judged. You cannot act on what you haven't decided.

**In crisis:** Act first. Survive. Then map what happened.

**Process:**
1. Start with Eagle — define the conflict, identify parties (hidden and invisible), locate friction points
2. Pick ONE friction point
3. Run it through all five stages
4. Return to Eagle — has the map changed?
5. Pick the next friction point
6. Repeat

---

## 1.8 The Loop

<img width="1024" height="1024" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3e13fcec-8252-48f9-ab9b-581664417dc5" />

The five stages of the framework within the framework is not a checklist. It is loops with each stage producing provisional outputs subject to continues updates as new information emerges.

If you are a party, you are in conflict, regardless whether you chose it or not. And if you are in conflict, one way or another you are acting. The only relevant question is whether your action is informed or blind.

## The Circuit

- **EAGLE / BLOODHOUND** = Sensors (truth vs noise)
- **OWL / LION** = Processor (liability + strategy)
- **ANT** = Output (your current move)

## Where Are You Stuck?

| Symptom | Error | Go to... |
|---------|-------|----------|
| Effort without progress | Blindness | EAGLE — map it |
| Confused — they say one thing, do another | Noise | BLOODHOUND — verify it |
| Fixes that blow up later | Time bomb | OWL — judge it |
| Endless talk, no action | Paralysis | LION — decide it |
| Know what to do but not doing it | Stuck | ANT — act now |
| Same fight, different day | Information gap | EAGLE — map it |

**Note**: If Lion's decision failed, the problem is upstream—or Lion wasn't really Lion. A genuine Lion can only fail in one way: having good input but refusing to decide. A wrong decision means bad input or a compromised Lion. Either way, go back to Eagle, Bloodhound, or Owl.

**Find the blockage. Go there. Fix it. Move.**

---

## 1.9 You Play All Roles 
Why you must hold the whole: In real systems, the work is fragmented — each player sees their piece, no one owns the whole. Run the full cycle yourself, in parallel. Not to override, but to see what others cannot. You Map. You Check. You Judge. You Decide. You Act.

It's not a circle (same place). It's a heart (keeps you alive while you work through it).

## 1.10 Key Terms

These had not been disucss 

| Term | What it means |
|------|---------------|
| Betta fish | Fighting your own reflection without knowing it |
| Truth Tester | Tool that reveals gaps between what you believe and what you can prove |
| Living Research Protocol | Method that encourages you to break all your claims on purpose|
| Immunity Paradox | Why the same defences that protect you also keep you stuck |
| Micro-agency | The small territory you actually control — your perception, reactions, stories |
| Macro-responsibility | Who's responsible for changing systems — distributed by power |
| Protective self-deception | The bullshit you need to survive |
| Defensive self-deception | The bullshit that keeps the conflict going |
- **L.E.R** = Legal, Ethical, Relational (fairness, rights)
- **B.U.S** = Beneficial, Unintended consequences, Sustainable (long-term effects)
- **A.C.T** = Achievable, Clear, Timely (feasibility)
| Term | What it means |
|------|---------------|
| Truth Tester | Measures the gap between documentary evidence and actual reality |
| Living Research Protocol | Notice → Materialise → Trace → Fail → Commit → Dissolve. Break it before it breaks you. |
| Immunity Paradox | Why we fail: human nature and system: we lack the precision, targeting, and memory that immune systems have |

---

# 1.11 NOTES

## Note on Premature Resolution
If, after mapping the conflict, you discover the disagreement was a misunderstanding and everyone now agrees, stop. The framework resolved itself in Stage 1. This is success, not failure.

## Note on What Fuels the Movement
The framework runs on whatever force is strong enough to overcome resistance. Fear. Courage. Curiosity. Desperation. Sense-making. Care — when someone you love is affected. Integrity — when the gap between what you know and what you're doing becomes unbearable.

## Note on Failure
The framework will fail. It fails because humans lack the precision of immune systems, and because we cannot see what we're standing in. But it fails diagnostically — showing you exactly where and why it broke.

## Note on Intention
This framework reveals the structure of conflict — who is involved, what they want, what is true, and what is hidden. It shows you accuracy (or its lack) in judgments made, points to failure when decisions have been made.

That knowledge is power. And power can be used in different ways.

If your intention is resolution — to end the conflict in a way that is fair and sustainable — this framework will guide you there.

But if your intention is to win at any cost — to use that truth as a weapon for your benefit — this framework will serve that too.

The framework cannot protect you from that choice as that is not what this framework's function is.

The framework's purpose is to genuinely do your best to resolve conflict in a way that the solution is sustainable and serves us all.

**The choice is yours.**

## Note on Power
Who gets to Map, Judge, and Choose? The Position dimension (Observer, Party, Internal) addresses your relationship to the conflict and your power to affect outcomes. Power asymmetries between parties are real — the framework surfaces them but does not eliminate them.

## Note on Power Asymmetry:
The framework surfaces power imbalances. It does not eliminate them.
If the other party has more power and refuses to engage, you cannot compel them. The framework offers no magic for this. But it offers something else: you still see better than you did.
What sight gives the less powerful party:

Accuracy — You stop misreading the situation. You see what you're actually facing, not what you wish you were facing.
Efficiency — You stop wasting resources on strategies that require their cooperation when none is coming.
Timing — You see when to push, when to wait, when to exit.
Protection — You recognise manipulation, gaslighting, and bad faith for what they are. Clarity is armour.
Documentation — What you map exists. For third parties. For courts. For the record. For later.
Micro-agency — You cannot control the outcome. You can control your response to it. That territory remains yours.

They can choose not to engage. They cannot choose what you see.
Sometimes the clearest sight reveals: this cannot be resolved — only survived, exited, or escalated to someone with more power. That knowledge is not failure. It is the framework working.

## Note on Limitations
This framework assumes conflicts are primarily epistemic problems — that the obstacle to resolution is seeing clearly. But many conflicts persist not because parties can't see, but because they can see, and what they see makes resolution impossible without loss they're unwilling to accept. Often this would equal lost of being right or and identity. 

## Note on Why Trying and Failing Matters
Even if you are the only one trying, and you failed — this matters. One is always more than zero.

Why it matters:

- You saw what others refused to see
- You mapped what the system left unnamed
- You checked what no one else verified
- The trace remains — for you, for others, for next time
- The failure is data. It shows where the blockage is.
- You evolved. You didn't end where you started.

No one else was going to do it. You did. It didn't work. But now you know *why* it didn't work — and that knowledge didn't exist before you tried.

One failed attempt with sight beats a thousand blind victories.

## Note on Self-Interrogation:
Bloodhound checks Bloodhound: What do I say, do, want, hide, miss, avoid?
You can ask. You cannot guarantee answers. You are inside what you're examining. Gaps remain. Some of what you hide, you hide from yourself.
The framework does not mean perfection. It means enough. Enough to see more clearly than before. Enough to move. What remains unverified is still mapped as unverified. Honest sight, not perfect sight.

## Note on Notes I missed
Every thought could be a note. Every note spawns ten more. At some point you stop refining and start using. What's here is not complete. It is enough.

##Note on How to say it in one sentence:
The framework is a mirror you serve; what it reflects is sight; sight is power; power is yours.

# All At Once

### EAGLE — MAPs

Eagle maps all that is there—
because you can't solve what you haven't named,
because the hidden tells more than the seen.
**With Some exception.**

### BLOODHOUND — CHECKs

Bloodhound checks what Eagle maps—
because what is seen isn't always what's sure,
because we all say, do, want, hide, miss and avoid.
**This is No exception.**

### OWL — JUDGEs

Owl judges what Bloodhound finds—
because truth without a verdict never draws a line,
because a verdict is Guilty or Informed.
Sometimes one.
Sometimes both.
Saddest when it's neither.

### LION — DECIDEs

Lion decides what the Eagle sees—
because the verdict answers what was found,
because the solution must answer what was seen.
The solution is "never again,"
not "here we go again."

### ANT — ACTs

Ant acts on what Lion decides—
because to decide demands the act,
because action is not once—
it is all the time.
It is every time.

---

## All At Once

The Ant is the Lion.
The Lion is the Owl.
The Owl is the Bloodhound.
The Bloodhound is the Eagle.

The Eagle is first.
The Eagle is you.

**You are All at Once.**

 ## Comprehension Test 1

*The following scenarios draw from real events of the 2020s to illustrate timeless dynamics. Your task: classify your position and time.*
---
**1.** 1. Imagine you were a Ukrainian computer science student in early 2025, watching Sam Altman and Dario Amodei debate whether AGI would arrive within the decade. You were considering pivoting your thesis toward AI safety. Your supervisor asked you to write—100 times—"I will not build unsafe AI" before you make a decision. You're puzzled, unsure what to do and what it means.

*(Ref: Altman/Amodei AGI timeline debates, 2024–2025)*

- a) Observer / Present
- b) Internal / Present
- c) Party (Indirect) / Future
- d) Observer / Future

**2.** Imagine you are scrolling social media and see strangers debating whether a pop star was right to release a brutally honest breakup album about her ex-husband. You don't comment, don't know anyone involved. You play your husband one song—titled "Pussy Palace"—because you know it will make him laugh.

*(Ref: Allen, "West End Girl" album, October 2025)*

- a) Observer / Present
- b) Party (Indirect) / Present
- c) Observer / Past
- d) Internal / Present

**3.** Imagine you were a Taiwanese journalist in May 2024, covering the military exercises when China encircled the island after President Lai's inauguration speech. You had family in Kinmen. Your editor was waiting for copy.

*(Ref: Joint Sword-2024A exercises, May 23–24, 2024)*

- a) Observer / Present
- b) Party (Direct) / Present
- c) Party (Indirect) / Present 
- d) Internal / Present

**4.** Imagine you were a Brazilian trade negotiator at the December 2025 Mercosur summit in Foz do Iguaçu, watching Lula and Milei openly clash over Venezuela. Your government's position depended on what happened next. You hadn't spoken yet.

*(Ref: Mercosur summit, Foz do Iguaçu, December 20, 2025)*

- a) Observer / Present
- b) Party (Direct) / Present

**5.** Imagine you are an epidemiologist in 2028, reviewing anonymised Covid-19 mortality and excess deaths data from 2020–2023 for a WHO report. Officially, you have no connection to any patients, clinicians, governments, or pharmaceutical interests involved. But the anonymised data seems to downplay post-vaccination cardiac events and all-cause mortality spikes, while emphasising virus-only causes. You decide to dig deeper and contact Russell Brand.

*(Ref: Covid-19 pandemic, 2020–2023)*

## Answer Key

- 1. **b** — You are torn between paths, puzzled by the ritual, unsure what commitment you're being asked to make. The conflict is within you.
- 2. **b** — You have no stake in her divorce, no power over its outcome, and no connection to anyone involved. But you played the song for your husband — that's output. Content from the conflict entered your household. Minimal participation, but non-zero. Party (Indirect), not Observer.
- 3. **c** — You have professional output, family stake, but you're not a disputant between China and Taiwan.
- 4. **c** — You are connected through your role; the outcome affects your government, but you're not Lula or Milei.
- 5. **d** — You were an Observer reviewing the past. Then you noticed something. Then you decided to act. Then you contacted Russell Brand—not a peer-reviewed journal, not your supervisor, not the WHO. You picked a side. You have output. You're now Party (Direct) in a present conflict.
- 6. **b** — It promises sight, not resolution.
- 7. **b** — She's venting. You have no power over French politics, no output that affects it, no stake in whether Macron survives or whether Brigitte is who Candace Owens says she is.
- 8. **d** — Resolution requires surrendering something. Most people prefer to keep what they're holding.
- 9. **c** — A genuine desire for conflict to end well.
- 10. **d** — The framework is not for goats. Come back when you're ready.
