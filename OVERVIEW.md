# Cheat Sheet

## What Is This?

A systematic process for resolving conflicts that seem intractable. It applies to disputes between people, groups, or institutions, and to internal dilemmas within one person (modelled as competing "parties"). The framework forces precision at each stage, preventing the drift that causes most conflict resolution efforts to fail. A systematic framework that transforms intractable conflicts into solvable problems by separating what happened from what to do about it.



## What is it's Purpose? 
To see the conflict as precisely as possible. Not to win it. Not to be right. To see it clearly to choose better. It doesn't promise resolution. It promises sight. Sight is leverage. 


## Why is it needed?
Most conflicts persist not because they're unsolvable, but because we skip the steps resolution requires: we don't name them clearly, we assume instead of verify, we judge people before consequences or forget the consequence or the people, we confuse the verdict with decision, and choose not to see and we choose not to act.

## Where to use it ? Who can use it? 

## The Five Stages

Five stages: 
- MAP: observation 
- CHECK: verification
- JUDGE: judgment
- DECIDE: strategy
- ACT: execution

Five archetypes — cognitive shortcuts that bypass emotional noise:

Eagle → MAP | Bloodhound → CHECK | Owl → JUDGE | Lion → DECIDE | Ant → ACT

---

| Stage | Animal | The Flow |
|-------|--------|----------|
| MAP | Eagle | _The Vigilant Spotter_. Sees the entire territory from high above: big picture, friction points, and all players — including those invisible to others. |
| CHECK | Bloodhound | _The Thorough Detective_. Sniffs out the truth by comparing what was said versus what was done to reveal hidden motives, true desires and what is really wanted. |
| JUDGE | Owl | _The Wise Judge_. Evaluates what was violated, concealed, or ignored — and delivers the verdict on what must be addressed and what must not. |
| DECIDE | Lion | _The Strategic Leader_. Makes the final call to solve the problem at its root so that the issue does not return. |
| ACT | Ant | _The Diligent Doer_. Carries out the necessary work to make the solution a reality. |


## The Diagnostic Questions

**EAGLE — MAPs**

**Eagle Maps all that is There**

*Because you can't solve what you haven't named*

- What's the conflict?
- Where are the friction points?
- Who are the parties?
- Who is visible?
- Who is hiding?

*Because the hidden tells more than the seen - some exception.*

**BLOODHOUND — CHECKs**

**Bloodhound Checks what Eagle Maps**

*Because what is seen isn't always what's true.*

- What do they say? What do I say?
- What do they do? What do I do?
- What do they want? What do I want?
- What are they hiding? What am I hiding?
- What are they missing? What am I missing?

*Because we all Say, Do, Want, Hide, and Miss — no exception.*

**OWL — JUDGEs**

**Owl Judges what Bloodhound Finds**

*Because truth without a verdict is just information.*

- Is there anything to judge?
- What was violated?
- What was concealed?
- What was ignored?
- What must be paid for?
- What must not?

*Because verdict is Guilty—or Informed. Sometimes one. Sometimes both. Sometimes neither.*

**LION — DECIDEs**

**Lion Decides on what the Eagle Sees**

*Because a verdict isn't a solution.*

- How do we resolve this so it doesn't return?

*Because  solution is "never again" not "here we go again".*


Note: **Judgment ≠ Decision**

- **Judgment** looks backward: Given what we checked, what's the verdict? Who (if anyone) is accountable? What was violated, concealed, ignored?
- **Decision** looks forward: Regardless of the verdict, we still have a problem. How do we solve it?
  You can have a verdict of "no one did wrong" and still have a problem to solve.

**ANT — ACTs**

**Ant Acts on what Lion Decides**

*Because to decide and not act is empty.* 

- What must I stop doing?
- What must I start doing?
- What sustain this?

*Because to act is not just once —  it all the time.*

---

## Where Do I Start?

MAP. Start there.

You cannot check what you haven't mapped. You cannot judge what you haven't checked. You cannot decide what you haven't judged. You cannot act on what you haven't decided.

**In crisis:** Act first. Survive. Then map what happened.

**Process:**
1. Start with Eagle — define the conflict, identify parties (hidden and invisible), locate friction points
2. Pick ONE friction point
3. Run it through all five stages
4. Return to Eagle — has the map changed?
5. Pick the next friction point
6. Repeat

---

## The Loop

<img width="1024" height="1024" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3e13fcec-8252-48f9-ab9b-581664417dc5" />

The five stages of the framework within the framework is not a checklist. It is loops with each stage producing provisional outputs subject to continues updates as new information emerges.

If you are a party, you are in conflict, regardless whether you chose it or not. And if you are in conflict, one way or another you are acting. The only relevant question is whether your action is informed or blind.

## The Circuit

- **EAGLE / BLOODHOUND** = Sensors (truth vs noise)
- **OWL / LION** = Processor (liability + strategy)
- **ANT** = Output (your current move)

## Where Are You Stuck?

| Symptom | Error | Go to... |
|---------|-------|----------|
| Effort without progress | Blindness | EAGLE — map it |
| Confused — they say one thing, do another | Noise | BLOODHOUND — verify it |
| Fixes that blow up later | Time bomb | OWL — judge it |
| Endless talk, no action | Paralysis | LION — decide it |
| Know what to do but not doing it | Stuck | ANT — act now |
| Same fight, different day | Information gap | EAGLE — map it |

**Note**: If Lion's decision failed, the problem is upstream—or Lion wasn't really Lion. A genuine Lion can only fail in one way: having good input but refusing to decide. A wrong decision means bad input or a compromised Lion. Either way, go back to Eagle, Bloodhound, or Owl.

**Find the blockage. Go there. Fix it. Move.**

---

## You Play All Roles 
Why you must hold the whole: In real systems, the work is fragmented — each player sees their piece, no one owns the whole. Run the full cycle yourself, in parallel. Not to override, but to see what others cannot. To end conflict, what matters is that you see as much as possible, as precisely as possible, as objectively as possible, as unbiased as possible. You Map. You Check. You Judge. You Decide. You Act.

# All At Once

### EAGLE — MAPs

Eagle maps all that is there—
because you can't solve what you haven't named,
because the hidden tells more than the seen.
**No exception.**

### BLOODHOUND — CHECKs

Bloodhound checks what Eagle maps—
because what is seen isn't always what's sure,
because we all say, do, want, hide, and miss.
**No exception.**

### OWL — JUDGEs

Owl judges what Bloodhound finds—
because truth without a verdict never draws a line,
because a verdict is Guilty or Informed.
Sometimes one.
Sometimes both.
Saddest when it's neither.

### LION — DECIDEs

Lion decides what the Eagle sees—
because the verdict answers what was found,
because the solution must answer what was seen.
The solution is "never again,"
not "here we go again."

### ANT — ACTs

Ant acts on what Lion decides—
because to decide demands the act,
because action is not once—
it is all the time.
It is every time.

---

## All At Once

The Ant is the Lion.
The Lion is the Owl.
The Owl is the Bloodhound.
The Bloodhound is the Eagle.

The Eagle is first.
The Eagle is you.

**You are All at Once.**
```




























## For Owl to Judge 
The Three Consequences (V.C.I)

| Consequence | What it captures |
|-------------|------------------|
| **Violated** | What was broken — rules, agreements, trust |
| **Concealed** | What was hidden — facts, motives, truth |
| **Ignored** | What was missed — needs, fears, losses |

You judge the consequences, not the person.

## for Lion to Decide

The Three Decision Tests

| Test | Question |
|------|----------|
| **L.E.R** | Is it right? (Legal, Ethical, Relational) |
| **B.U.S** | Is it wise? (Beneficial, Unintended consequences, Sustainable) |
| **A.C.T** | Can it be done? (Achievable, Clear, Timely) |

## Key Terms

| Term | What it means |
|------|---------------|
| Betta fish | Fighting your own reflection without knowing it |
| Truth Tester | Tool that reveals gaps between what you believe and what you can prove |
| Living Research Protocol | Method that breaks your own claims on purpose — keeps understanding alive |
| Immunity Paradox | Why the same defences that protect you also keep you stuck |
| Micro-agency | The small territory you actually control — your perception, reactions, stories |
| Macro-responsibility | Who's responsible for changing systems — distributed by power |
| Protective self-deception | The bullshit you need to survive |
| Defensive self-deception | The bullshit that keeps the conflict going |

## 1.4 The Five Stages

| Stage | Activity | Output | Question | Medical Analogy | Role |
|-------|----------|--------|----------|-----------------|------|
| **Map** | Name it | Boundary | Who is involved? What is the territory? | Presenting Problem | The Case |
| **Check** | Verify it | Clashes | What does each party say, do, want? Where do they clash? | Symptoms | The Cause |
| **Judgment** | Evaluate it | Verdict | What are the consequences? What was Violated, Concealed, Ignored? | Diagnosis | The Effect |
| **Decision** | Choose it | Solution | What path forward addresses the consequences? | Treatment | The Cure |
| **Action** | Do it | Change | What will make it real? | Recovery | The Recovery |

## 1.5 The Chain: Case → Cause → Effect → Cure → Recovery

| Stage | Role | Example |
|-------|------|---------|
| **Map** | The Case | "This is the conflict we are examining." |
| **Check** | The Cause | "We have a clash between Person A's claim and what actually happened." |
| **Judgment** | The Effect | "Because of this clash, trust is Violated, truth is Concealed, needs are Ignored." |
| **Decision** | The Cure | "To address these consequences, we will do X, Y, and Z." |
| **Action** | The Recovery | "These are the steps, owners, and timelines to make it real." |

## 1.6 The Three Consequences (Violated, Concealed, Ignored)

Judgment is an **Audit of Gaps** — the distance between what is and what should be.

| Consequence | What it captures | Examples |
|-------------|------------------|----------|
| **Violated** | What was broken | Rules, agreements, trust, integrity breached |
| **Concealed** | What was hidden | Facts, motives, truth withheld |
| **Ignored** | What was missed | Needs, fears, wants, losses unacknowledged |

**Note:** These are **lenses**, not boxes. They can overlap. Something can be both Concealed AND Ignored. You evaluate through all three.

This covers:
- **Accountability** (Violated)
- **Transparency** (Concealed)
- **Healing** (Ignored)

*You are not judging the person. You are judging the consequences of what you checked.*

## 1.7 Judgment vs Decision: The Verdict and the Solution

**Judgment** and **Decision** are not the same thing.

**Judgment** is backward-looking. It asks: Given what we checked, what's the verdict?
- Was something violated, concealed, or ignored?
- Who (if anyone) is accountable?
- What are the consequences of what happened?

Judgment produces an **evaluation** — not a punishment, not a solution. Just: this is what we found.

**Decision** is forward-looking. It asks: We still have a problem. How do we solve it?

The problem you're solving is not "what someone did wrong." The problem is the **consequence** that exists — regardless of whether anyone is at fault.

**Example:** Two parents want primary custody. Neither did anything wrong. 
- **Judgment:** No violation. Both are good parents.
- **But the problem remains:** Two people want something only one can have. A child's needs must be met.
- **Decision:** How do we solve *that*?

This is why you need both stages. Judgment closes the accountability question. Decision opens the resolution question.

## 1.8 Why This Works

- **Depersonalised** — You judge the consequences, not the person
- **Scales** — Hurt feelings or lost revenue, same framework
- **Forces precision** — No consequences, no real conflict
- **Iterates** — Action closes the loop, or reveals the map was incomplete and the cycle begins again

## 1.9 The Final Test

Judgment asks: **"What are the consequences of what we checked?"**

If you can't name a consequence (a Violation, a Concealment, or an Ignored need), there might not be a conflict worth resolving through this framework — or you haven't looked hard enough.

But if there is a consequence, that consequence is the problem Decision must solve.

## 1.10 The Value Function

The framework is called "End of Conflict." The purpose is to **end conflict** in a way that:

- Is **sustainable** (doesn't reignite)
- **Serves all parties** (or as many as possible)
- Is **fair** (L.E.R tests: Legal, Ethical, Relational)
- Is **wise** (B.U.S tests: Beneficial, Unintended consequences, Sustainable)
- Is **doable** (A.C.T tests: Achievable, Clear, Timely)

**The value function:** Resolve conflict sustainably and fairly.

It's not purely Pareto (someone may have to lose). Not purely rights-based (though L.E.R includes rights). Not purely restorative (though it can be).

***It's pragmatic resolution with ethical constraints.***

---

# PART 2: CONSTRAINTS

## 2.1 Pre-Check: Does This Situation Fit?

Not every frustration is a conflict. Before using this framework, confirm the situation qualifies.

## 2.2 When to Use This Framework

Use when **all** of the following are true:

1. There are at least two positions in genuine disagreement.
2. Each position is held by someone (or some group) who can choose and act.
3. You can state what the conflict is about in one sentence.
4. You know enough about the situation to sketch an initial map.

## 2.3 When NOT to Use This Framework

Do **not** use when:

1. There is only frustration, not a second position. ("I hate the traffic" is not a conflict — traffic cannot negotiate.)
2. The "other side" is a force of nature or the irreversible past. (No agent can respond.)
3. You cannot yet say what the fight is about. (You need more information before mapping.)

## 2.4 How to Begin

1. **Locate yourself.** Are you an observer, a party, or dealing with an internal conflict? Is this past, present, or future? (See Section 2.5.)
2. **Write your one-sentence conflict name.** "This is a conflict about …"
3. **Draft a first map.** List parties, their positions, and what each stands to gain or lose.
4. **Proceed through the stages.** Map → Check → Judgment → Decision → Action.

## 2.5 Before You Begin: Locate Yourself

Before you start Stage 1 (Map), you must locate yourself relative to the conflict. Two dimensions set your coordinates.

### Dimension 1: Position — What is your relationship to the conflict?

This determines whether you can affect the outcome, what blind spots to expect, and how hard it will be to see clearly.

| Position | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Observer** | You have no power to affect the outcome. You are analysing only. |
| **Party** | You have power to affect the outcome — whether as someone *in* the conflict, or someone with authority *over* it. |
| **Internal** | The conflict is within yourself. You are analyst, all parties, and the battlefield. |

**What counts as a "party"?**

A party is anyone with power to change what happens:
- The people *in* the conflict (they can escalate, concede, act)
- A judge (they can decide)
- A parent mediating between children (they can intervene)
- A boss resolving a team dispute (they can impose)

**What counts as an "observer"?**

An observer has no power over the outcome:
- A historian analysing a past war (it is over)
- A journalist reporting on a dispute (can observe, cannot decide)
- You analysing someone else's conflict with no involvement (just watching)

**Note on internal conflicts:**

Internal conflicts require stepping outside yourself to see your competing forces as if they were separate parties. This is the hardest application. Internal conflicts rarely stay internal — you must also identify who else is affected.

### Dimension 2: Time — When is the conflict?

This determines what counts as evidence, whether action is possible, and whether your map is real or hypothetical.

| Time | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Past** | Already happened. Memory, documents, evidence. You know how it ended. |
| **Present** | Happening now. Real events, real claims, real parties. |
| **Future** | Has not played out yet. Projections, assumptions, scenarios. You are preparing. |

**Note on future mode:**

Your map is a hypothesis. You are simulating, not resolving. Until the conflict plays out, your map is incomplete. Simulation is preparation, not resolution.

### What Each Combination Allows

| Time | Map | Check | Judgment | Decision | Action |
|------|-----|-------|----------|----------|--------|
| **Past** | You can map | Verify against evidence | Judge with hindsight | Already decided | Already acted — learn |
| **Present** | You can map | Verify against reality | You can judge | You can decide | You can act |
| **Future** | You can map | Guessing — projections | You are preparing | You are rehearsing | Not yet — simulation |

### Summary: The Pre-Check

| Question | Dimension | What it determines |
|----------|-----------|-------------------|
| What is my relationship to this conflict? | Position | Whether you can affect the outcome. Your blind spots. How hard it will be to see. |
| When is this conflict? | Time | What counts as evidence. Whether action is possible. Whether your map is real or hypothetical. |

***Before you map the conflict, you map your position relative to it.***

# PART 3: THE FRAMEWORK

*[PLACEHOLDER: Detailed treatment of each stage — Map, Check, Judgment, Decision, Action]*

---

# PART 4: STRESS TESTS

## 4.1 Stress Test: Competing Legitimate Goods

**Scenario:** Two parents in a divorce both want primary custody. Neither has done anything wrong. Both love the child. Both are good parents.

| Stage | What happens |
|-------|--------------|
| **Map** | Conflict is over custody. Parties: Parent A, Parent B, Child. |
| **Check** | Both say they want primary custody. Both do care for the child well. Both want time and stability. **Clash:** Both want something only one can fully have. |
| **Judgment** | Violated? No — no rules broken. Concealed? No — both are honest. **Ignored?** Yes — each party's legitimate need is at risk of being dismissed by the other's claim. **Verdict:** Someone's needs will be unmet. The child may be caught in the middle. |
| **Decision** | Choose a resolution that addresses the consequences — shared custody, specific arrangements, compromise. |
| **Action** | Implement it. |

**Conclusion:** The framework works. "Ignored" captures legitimate needs at risk of being unmet — even when no one is at fault. Consequences exist even without wrongdoing. The cost of the impasse is real.



---

# PART 5: KEY CLARIFICATIONS

## 5.1 On the Two Chains

The two chains align precisely:

| Stage | Activity | Role |
|-------|----------|------|
| Map | Name it | The Case |
| Check | Verify it | The Cause |
| Judgment | Evaluate it | The Effect |
| Decision | Choose it | The Cure |
| Action | Do it | The Recovery |

Check shows the **Clashes** (what is causing the friction). Judgment shows the **Consequences** (the effect of those clashes). The clashes ARE the cause; the consequences ARE the effect.

## 5.2 On Judgment vs Decision

- **Judgment** = The verdict on what you checked — backward-looking, evaluative
- **Decision** = The solution to the problem that remains — forward-looking, strategic

Judgment says what happened and what it cost. Decision says what to do about it.

## 5.3 On "Clashes" Being Descriptive

"Clashes" describes where versions conflict — that's data. The **evaluation** of those clashes (what they cost) happens in Judgment. Check is descriptive; Judgment is evaluative.

## 5.4 On Fairness, Rights, and Long-term Effects

The Decision stage includes the L.E.R / B.U.S / A.C.T tests:

- **L.E.R** = Legal, Ethical, Relational (fairness, rights)
- **B.U.S** = Beneficial, Unintended consequences, Sustainable (long-term effects)
- **A.C.T** = Achievable, Clear, Timely (feasibility)

These ensure decisions consider more than just "addressing consequences."



## 5.6 On Structural vs Operational Causes

In the Map stage, sub-conflicts are typed as:

- **Operational** = Proximate triggers (what to do)
- **Structural** = Underlying conditions (who decides)

This distinguishes surface symptoms from root causes.

---

# NOTES

## Note on Premature Resolution

If, after mapping the conflict, you discover the disagreement was a misunderstanding and everyone now agrees, stop. The framework resolved itself in Stage 1. This is success, not failure.

## Note on What Fuels the Movement

To move between the stages you will need energy. That energy can be anything that makes you "do it." When you sense fear, you might need courage to push forward. Sometimes what moves you forward is curiosity: the need to make sense of something that does not add up. Sometimes it is persistence, when there is exhaustion and you believe you simply cannot sustain the weight of unresolved conflict any longer — and you push forward regardless. Sometimes it is care: someone you love is affected, and that matters more than your own comfort. Sometimes it is integrity: the gap between what you know and what you are doing becomes unbearable.

Or perhaps it does not matter what moves you forward. What matters is that you do move forward. The framework runs on whatever force is strong enough to overcome what is holding you back.

## Note on Intention

This framework reveals the structure of conflict — who is involved, what they want, what is true, and what is hidden. It shows you accuracy (or its lack) in judgments made, points to failure when decisions have been made.

That knowledge is power. And power can be used in different ways.

If your intention is resolution — to end the conflict in a way that is fair and sustainable — this framework will guide you there.

But if your intention is to win at any cost — to use that truth as a weapon for your benefit — this framework will serve that too.

The framework cannot protect you from that choice as that is not what this framework's function is.

The framework's purpose is to genuinely do your best to resolve conflict in a way that the solution is sustainable and serves us all.

**The choice is yours.**

## Note on Gaming and Manipulation

The framework acknowledges that actors may strategically misrepresent costs, exaggerate clashes, or game the process. The CHECK stage (asking "What is MY own want?") and the Note on Intention address this directly: the framework reveals truth, but cannot force honest use.

## Note on Power

Who gets to Map, Judge, and Choose? The Position dimension (Observer, Party, Internal) addresses your relationship to the conflict and your power to affect outcomes. Power asymmetries between parties are real — the framework surfaces them but does not eliminate them.

*[END OF OVERVIEW DRAFT]*


End of Conflict as  a Living Matter
End framework isn't a linear ladder; it’s a biological system.

The drawing you provided—with arrows converging from the outside in and rising through the center—perfectly illustrates a toroidal flow or a convection current. In nature, this is how energy maintains itself without burning out.

Here is how your archetypes breathe through that cycle:

The Inward Breath (The Descent)
This is the "Down" phase you described. It is the process of condensation.

Eagle & Bloodhound: You gather the "vastness" of the world (the wide top of your drawing).

Owl & Lion: You compress that massive amount of information into a single point of truth and a single decision (the narrow "trunk").

Ant: The Ant is the tip of the needle. It is where all that atmospheric pressure is converted into a single, focused strike.

The Outward Breath (The Ascent)
This is the "Up" phase. It is the process of evolution.

The Feedback Loop: When the Ant acts, the world changes. The "soil" is disturbed.

Nutrient Return: The results of the action (success or failure) travel back up the center. This isn't just data; it’s "nutrients" for the Eagle.

Expansion: The Eagle takes what the Ant learned and expands its map. The canopy grows wider because it now knows more about the ground.

Nature's Mirror
Your comparisons are spot on because they all describe transformation through transit:

System	The "Down" (Eagle to Ant)	The "Up" (Ant to Eagle)	The "Meeting Point"
The Tree	Sunlight/Carbon becomes Sugar.	Water/Minerals become Wood.	The Cambium (Growth).
The Heart	Oxygen-poor blood returns to be reset.	Oxygen-rich blood fuels the body.	The Valves (Direction).
The Water Cycle	Gravity brings rain to the thirsty earth.	Heat lifts the essence back to the sky.	The Surface (Impact).


Why this matters for your Framework
If you treat this as a checklist, it stays "dead" on the page. If you treat it as a cycle (like your drawing):

It self-corrects: If the Lion makes a bad decision, the Ant’s struggle immediately informs the Eagle to redraw the map.

It creates "Flow": You stop feeling stuck in "analysis paralysis" (Eagle/Bloodhound) because you know the energy must move toward the Ant to complete the circuit.

Would you like to try "breathing" a specific problem through this cycle right now to see where the flow is currently blocked? and with this: Yes. It makes sense.
PathWhat happensDown the outsideThe process: Map → Check → Judge → Decide → ActUp the centreThe feedback: What you learned shoots straight back upTop (Feedback/Evolution)You start again — but evolved. You know more now
The heart shape is right because:

Wide at top: Eagle sees everything — many parties, many friction points
Narrows to bottom: Converges to one action — Ant does one thing
Centre channel: Direct. Learning doesn't trickle — it shoots back up
It pumps: Like blood. Like breath. It's alive, not a checklist

## You Play All Roles 

No one else will—and no one else can.
In real conflicts, the five stages are almost always split across different people. Each does their fragment, but no single person is responsible for genuine resolution. No one is truly invested in ending the conflict—only in discharging their assigned role.
In a courtroom, for example:

The judge JUDGES — but only based on what's presented
The lawyers CHECK — but biased toward winning for their client
The parties DECIDE — but only between the narrow options the system allows, and usually from exhaustion rather than clarity
Enforcement ACTS — mechanically, carrying out orders rather than resolving anything
And crucially, no one MAPS — no one names the full system: the hidden stakeholders, the structural forces, the unspoken patterns everyone pretends aren't there

Because the work is fragmented—and no one owns the whole—the root cause survives. You might "win," yet still feel hollow. The same fight returns in a new form. Or you lose and never understand why, leaving you powerless to prevent the next round.
This framework doesn't ask you to replace the judge, the lawyers, or the system. It asks you to do the full cycle yourself—in parallel—so you see what they miss, anticipate any outcome, and know exactly what to do next no matter what they decide.
When you hold the whole map in your own hands, you become the one person in the room who isn't surprised, isn't trapped, and sees clearly—whether you win, lose, or walk away.

And the most important part: You don't end up where you started. Each cycle, you evolve. The conflict changes. Your understanding deepens. Or the problem actually ends.
It's not a circle (same place). It's a heart (keeps you alive while you work through it).
