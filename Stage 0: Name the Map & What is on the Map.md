## Stage 0: Name the Map

**What this stage is:** Stage 0 is the foundation for understanding and solving conflicts. Before you can analyse or resolve anything, you must first define what you are dealing with. This stage focuses on naming what is on the map: **A) Parties** (who is involved) and **B) Conflict** (what they are fighting about).
It is the simplest part of the process — yet it is often skipped or done carelessly. If you get the map wrong, everything that follows will be wrong too.

**Objective:** Draw the map of the conflict before you analyse it.

**Why:** You cannot analyse what you haven't defined. This stage sets the boundaries. Everything in later stages (Stage 1: Truth, Stage 2: Judgment, Stage 3: Decision) will rest on the clarity of the componets you identify in Stage 0, i.e. Name the Map. If you skip this, your analysis will drift.

**Output:** A one-page map showing: Parties and Conflict — both named, categorised, and typed.

## The Structure

Stage 0 maps two things: **A. Parties** and **B. Conflict**

For each, you do three moves: **Name → Categorise → Type**

| Move | A. PARTIES | B. CONFLICT |
|------|------------|-------------|
| **1. Name** | List who is involved | Name the main conflict |
| **2. Categorise** | Main / Sub | Main conflict / Sub-conflicts |
| **3. Type** | Benefits / Loses / Both / ? | Operational / Structural / Both |

---

## A. PARTIES

### A1. Name

**What to do:** List everyone connected to the conflict.

**Why:** Conflicts persist because of parties you don't see. The visible fighters are easy to spot. The hidden beneficiaries are why the conflict won't end.

**How:** Ask these questions:
1. Who is visibly fighting?
2. Who else is connected but not visibly fighting?
3. For each party: what do they gain or lose if the conflict **continues** vs if it **ends**?

---

### A2. Categorise

**What to do:** Categorise each party by their level of visibility.

**Definitions:**

| Level | Definition |
|-------|------------|
| **Main** | Parties who visibly take actions inside the conflict |
| **Sub** | Parties who influence outcomes without taking visible action |

---

### A3. Type

**What to do:** Classify each party by their interest in the conflict continuing.

**Definitions:**

| Type | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Benefits** | Gains if conflict continues — they have no reason to end it |
| **Loses** | Harmed if conflict continues — they want it to end |
| **Both** | Gains something AND loses something — the conflict continues because what they gain is worth more to them than what they lose |
| **?** | Unclear — flag for Stage 1 |

**Why classify interests?** This tells you who wants peace and who doesn't. "Benefits" parties want the conflict to continue. "Loses" parties want it to end. "Both" parties are stuck in a trade-off — they tolerate the loss because they value the gain more.

---

### A. PARTIES — Fill in:

| Party | Level | Type | Notes |
|-------|-------|------|-------|
| *(example: Russia)* | Main | Both | Gains buffer zone, loses economic ties |
| | | | |
| | | | |
| | | | |

**Notes guidance:** Surface observations only. If the party is an organisation, you may note: who is the human decision-maker?

**When to stop:** You have listed everyone you can think of. Only include actors who could conceivably change their behaviour if the conflict ended. You can always add more later if Stage 1 reveals hidden parties.

---

## B. CONFLICT

### B1. Name

**What to do:** Name what the main parties are fighting about.

**Why:** This is the container. Everything else sits inside it. If you name it wrong, your whole analysis is off.

**How:** Ask — what would a newspaper headline say?

**The Test:** If this were resolved, would the current round of fighting visibly end?

**Definition:**

| Main Conflict |
|---------------|
| The visible, current, external fight. Not the history. Not the hidden causes. Just what you can see they are fighting about right now. |

**Non-examples (too abstract):**

| Wrong (analysis) | Right (map) |
|------------------|-------------|
| "Incompatible worldviews" | "Dispute over custody arrangements" |
| "Lack of trust" | "War in Ukraine" |
| "Control issues" | "Disagreement over phone rules" |

---

### B2. Categorise

**What to do:** List the specific fights inside the main conflict.

**Why:** The main conflict is the container. Sub-conflicts are what's inside. You will analyse each one separately in Stage 1.

**How:** Ask — what exactly are they fighting about? What are the individual disputes?

**Definition:**

| Sub-conflict |
|--------------|
| A specific, concrete disagreement. Something you could point to and say "they are fighting about this." |

**Aim for 3–6.** Fewer = under-mapped. More = too granular.

If you have more than 6: group similar ones together, or check if some belong in a different main conflict.

**Sanity check:** Each sub-conflict must obviously sit inside the main conflict. If it doesn't, rewrite the main conflict — or park that dispute for a separate map.

---

### B3. Type

**What to do:** Classify each sub-conflict.

**Why:** The type tells you how hard it will be to resolve and what kind of solution is needed.

**How:** Ask — is this fight about what to do, or about who gets to decide?

**Definitions:**

| Type | Definition | How to recognise |
|------|------------|------------------|
| **Operational** | They agree who decides. They disagree about what to do. | "We both have authority, we just disagree on the approach." |
| **Structural** | They disagree about who has the right to decide. | "I don't accept your authority" or "Who controls this?" |
| **Both** | Operational on the surface, but it keeps recurring because the structural question is unresolved. | Fights that never stay solved. |

**Why classify type?** Because you cannot fix a conflict using the wrong tool. If it's operational, you can negotiate the rule. If it's structural, you first have to agree who gets to decide — otherwise every rule you make will be fought again.

**Triggers for "Both":**
- A party frames it as a "matter of principle" or "this sets a precedent"
- Resolving the operational issue wouldn't actually stop this fight recurring

---

### B. CONFLICT — Fill in:

| Main Conflict |
|---------------|
| |

| Sub-conflict | Type |
|--------------|------|
| | Operational / Structural / Both |
| | Operational / Structural / Both |
| | Operational / Structural / Both |
| | Operational / Structural / Both |
| | Operational / Structural / Both |
| | Operational / Structural / Both |

## Stage 0 Output Checklist

Before moving to Stage 1 (TRUTH), confirm:

**A. Parties:**
- ✓ Named (listed all parties)
- ✓ Categorised (Main / Sub)
- ✓ Typed (Benefits / Loses / Both / ?)

**B. Conflict:**
- ✓ Named (main conflict passes newspaper test)
- ✓ Categorised (3–6 sub-conflicts, each inside the main conflict)
- ✓ Typed (each sub-conflict: Operational / Structural / Both)

---

## What You Now Have

You have your map:

- **A. Parties** — who is involved, how visible they are (Main/Sub), and what their interest is (Benefits/Loses/Both)
- **B. Conflict** — what they are fighting about (main conflict), what the specific disputes are (sub-conflicts), and what type each dispute is (Operational/Structural/Both)

**But you don't know what's actually true.**

Each party has their version. Their version might be accurate, or wrong, or a lie, or a misunderstanding.

**To know what to do, you need to know what's true.**

---

## Why Zoom Into Sub-Conflicts?

The main conflict ("custody dispute" or "war in Ukraine") is too big to analyse directly. You cannot find truth at that level — it's just a label.

Truth lives in the specific disputes:
- Not "custody dispute" → but "the phone disagreement on 15 November"
- Not "war in Ukraine" → but "what happened in Bucha"

Each sub-conflict is where claims are made, actions are taken, and truth can be tested.

**Stage 0 is the view from above** — you see the whole territory.
**Stage 1 zooms in** — you walk into each sub-conflict and see what actually happened.

---

## The Link to Stage 1

**Stage 0 gives you the map** — who is playing, what they're fighting about, and what type of fight it is.

**But you cannot act on a map. You can only act on truth.**

**Stage 1 zooms into each sub-conflict, one by one, to find the truth:** what actually happened vs what is claimed.

Stage 1 asks, for each sub-conflict:
1. What happened? (the events)
2. What does each party say happened? (the claims)
3. Do they match?
4. Where they don't match — is it a lie, a mistake, a misunderstanding, or something hidden?

**Only when you know what is true (Stage 1) can you judge (Stage 2) and decide what to do (Stage 3).**


* The map may be revised as Stage 1 reveals new parties, conflicts, or information
* Note: The map reflects the map-maker's perspective. Different parties may draw different maps.



Instruction: 
Imagine you are giving Stage 0 to someone who knows nothing about the conflict and nothing about the framework. Your job is to tell them exactly what Stage 0 is and how to complete it.

Stage 0 should explain:
What Stage 0 is:
It is the step where they Name the Map — meaning:
What is on the map? (the conflicts)
Who is on the map? (the parties)

What they need to produce:
A clear map of the conflict with defined parties, defined conflicts, and correct classifications.

How they should do it:
You must guide them with:
How (instructions)
Why (the purpose behind each instruction)
Definitions (so nothing depends on interpretation)
Questions they can ask themselves to generate the right content

What the instructions must achieve:
The instructions must be:
Logical — each step follows naturally; no one questions the reasoning
Simple — they always know what action to take; zero confusion
Precise — every term and category is clearly defined; no ambiguity
Complete — nothing important is missing; they have everything they need
Bounded — they know exactly when they are finished; they don’t overwork the step

Finally Each Stage must logicallly connect to the next: e.g. We drew a Map in stage 0 so that... in stage 1, 2, 3: truth, judge, decide.....
