## Stage 0: NAME

**Objective:** Define what we are analysing before we analyse it.

**Why:** This is initial analysis. It forces precision before moving into deeper, more complex work. You cannot analyse a conflict you haven't defined. If you skip this, everything that follows will be vague or wrong.

**When to use:** Use this framework when there is an external, observable conflict between parties — something happening in the world that you can point to. This is not for internal conflicts ("I feel torn") or abstract tensions ("incompatible worldviews"). There must be a visible fight.

---

### Step 1: PARTIES

**What to do:** Identify everyone connected to the conflict.

**How:** Ask — who is involved and how?

| Role | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Direct** | The ones fighting each other |
| **Driver** | Influencing, causing, or benefiting — but not fighting directly |
| **Affected** | Impacted by the conflict, little or no power |
| **Collateral** | Drained by it without being part of it |

**Note on Drivers:** There are different types:

| Driver Type | Definition | Example |
|-------------|------------|---------|
| **Instigator** | Actively causing or escalating the conflict | Lawyer escalating a minor dispute; nation supplying weapons |
| **Sustainer** | Keeping the conflict going | Advisor encouraging refusal to settle |
| **Beneficiary** | Profiting from the conflict continuing | Defence contractor; politician exploiting division |

*A driver can be more than one type.*

**Why:** Different people have different roles. Some are fighting. Some are pulling strings. Some are profiting. Some are just caught in it. Knowing who is who stops you from blaming the wrong people or missing the real drivers.

| Direct | Driver (type) | Affected | Collateral |
|--------|---------------|----------|------------|
| | | | |

*Note: This step needs careful thinking. Take your time. If you get the parties wrong, everything else breaks.*

---

### Step 2: MAIN CONFLICT

**What to do:** Name what the direct parties are fighting about.

**How:** Ask — what is the fight about? Give it a name.

| Definition |
|------------|
| The visible, current, external fight. What would a newspaper headline say? |

**The Test:** If this conflict were resolved, would the current round of fighting visibly end?

**Warning — avoid meta-conflicts:** Do not jump to abstract, high-level framing like "incompatible worldviews" or "fundamental distrust." That is analysis, not naming. At this stage, you name what you can see, not what you think it means.

**Why:** You need a boundary. "War in Ukraine" or "Custody dispute between Father and Mother" — this is the container. Everything else sits inside it.

| Main Conflict |
|---------------|
| |

**Examples:**

| Situation | Main Conflict | NOT this (too abstract) |
|-----------|---------------|-------------------------|
| Family | Custody dispute between Father and Mother | "Fight over control" |
| Ukraine | War in Ukraine | "Clash of civilisations" |

*History and hidden causes come later, in Stage 1 (Truth). Here you just name what is happening now.*

---

### Step 3: SUB-CONFLICTS

**What to do:** List the specific fights that sit inside the main conflict.

**How:** Ask — what exactly are they fighting about? What are the individual disputes?

| Definition |
|------------|
| The specific, concrete disagreements. These are the symptoms. The main conflict is the container; sub-conflicts are what's inside. |

**Why:** Most big conflicts contain many smaller fights. Listing them shows you the pattern. You will analyse each one separately in Stage 1.

| Sub-conflict |
|--------------|
| |
| |
| |

**Examples:**

| Main Conflict | Sub-conflicts |
|---------------|---------------|
| Custody dispute between Father and Mother | Phone, Dentist, Therapy, Half-terms |
| War in Ukraine | Crimea, Donbas, NATO membership, Grain exports |

*Note: List key examples, not every possible one.*

---

### Step 4: TYPE

**What to do:** Classify each sub-conflict.

**How:** Ask — is this fight about how things are done, or about who has the power to decide?

| Type | Definition | How to Recognise |
|------|------------|------------------|
| **Operational** | They agree who decides. They disagree about *how* it should be done. | "We both have authority, we just disagree on the rules." |
| **Structural** | They disagree about *who has the right to decide*. | "I don't accept your authority" or "Who controls this?" |
| **Both** | The surface fight is operational, but it keeps happening because the structural question is unresolved. | Recurring fights that never stay solved. |

**Note on "Both":** If a party frames an operational dispute as a "matter of principle" or "this sets a precedent" — classify it as Both. The process fight is the symptom of an unresolved power question underneath.

**Note on Perception:** The structural/operational distinction is objective, but parties may *perceive* it differently. One side may see a simple operational disagreement; the other may see it as a threat to their authority. If either party treats it as structural, it likely is — or will become — Both.

**Why:** The type tells you how hard it will be to resolve. Operational = adjust the process. Structural = change who decides. Both = you must address the power question or the operational fights will never end.

| Sub-conflict | Type |
|--------------|------|
| | Operational / Structural / Both |
| | Operational / Structural / Both |
| | Operational / Structural / Both |

**Examples:**

| Sub-conflict | Type | Why |
|--------------|------|-----|
| Phone | Operational | Both parents have authority; they disagree on screen time rules |
| Who decides about medical care | Structural | Father doesn't accept Mother's right to decide |
| Donbas | Both | Fighting about territory (operational) but also about who controls it (structural) |

### Stage 0 Output

Before you move to Stage 1 (TRUTH), confirm you have:

- ✓ Parties identified (Direct, Driver with type, Affected, Collateral)
- ✓ Main conflict named (visible, current, external — passes the newspaper test)
- ✓ Sub-conflicts listed (what's inside the container)
- ✓ Each sub-conflict typed (Operational / Structural / Both)

---

Then Stage 1 analyses each sub-conflict one by one.



Instruction: 
Imagine you give someone who knows knowing a job to work our conflict and you tell them - Stage 0 is to Name - and then you need to give them a What to do (instruction, i.e. How, e.g. by asking a qustion) and Why (...) and defiction ... so like how woudl you structure Stabe 0 so somone can fallow and actully undestand but also so that their logic would not quesiton it why is that that?

Stage 1: Name
Objective: To define (i.e. name, or identify) a) what is/are the conflict(s), b) who are the parties c) what kind of type the conflict is.

a) Name the Conflict
 sometimes, we need to start from knowing what is that conflict that we are dealing with. And sometimes, we kind of think that we know or that we are clear about it. But we need to give our attention to naming what is that conflict because naming the conflict will give us the boundaries of what we are thinking about.

Naming the conflict would be saying: "this is a conflict about the phone," or "I do not know if we can say about phone or war of Ukraine or about Christmas or something like that." Right? Who are the parties? Are the parties not only involved in the conflict, but I just wonder if at this stage, should we be saying who are the parties impacted by the conflict? Maybe there should be categorization of parties who create the conflict or co-create the conflict, and parties who are the recipient of the conflict. Is that possible? I'm thinking because like children are innocent, but the conflicts it's kind of relating to them.

And then, how do we explain that we need to name what type of conflict is, and how do we explain that there is this basic distinction between structural, operational or both? 

2. Exact—your reasoning is rigorous and holds up. Every example the response throws at us can indeed be mapped into Operational, Structural, or Both at Stage 0. The “other types” (values, perceptions, resources, timing) are really motives, hidden dimensions, or contextual layers, not fundamentally new Stage 0 categories. Stage 0 is about what happened, who is involved, and the operational vs structural distinction, not why or how it feels, which belongs to Stage 1.

So yes: the O/S/both framework is sufficient for Stage 0, even when we test it against extreme diversity—war, politics, workplace, family, resources, ideology. Stage 1 (TRUTH) is where all those subtleties (hidden motives, misperceptions, psychological friction, values) get flagged.
