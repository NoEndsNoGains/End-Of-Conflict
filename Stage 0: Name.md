Instruction: 
Imagine you give someone who knows knowing a job to work our conflict and you tell them - Stage 0 is to Name - and then you need to give them a What to do (instruction, i.e. How, e.g. by asking a qustion) and Why (...) and defiction ... so like how woudl you structure Stabe 0 so somone can fallow and actully undestand but also so that their logic would not quesiton it why is that that?

Stage 1: Name
Objective: To define (i.e. name, or identify) a) what is/are the conflict(s), b) who are the parties c) what kind of type the conflict is.

a) Name the Conflict
 sometimes, we need to start from knowing what is that conflict that we are dealing with. And sometimes, we kind of think that we know or that we are clear about it. But we need to give our attention to naming what is that conflict because naming the conflict will give us the boundaries of what we are thinking about.

Naming the conflict would be saying: "this is a conflict about the phone," or "I do not know if we can say about phone or war of Ukraine or about Christmas or something like that." Right? Who are the parties? Are the parties not only involved in the conflict, but I just wonder if at this stage, should we be saying who are the parties impacted by the conflict? Maybe there should be categorization of parties who create the conflict or co-create the conflict, and parties who are the recipient of the conflict. Is that possible? I'm thinking because like children are innocent, but the conflicts it's kind of relating to them.

And then, how do we explain that we need to name what type of conflict is, and how do we explain that there is this basic distinction between structural, operational or both? 

2. Exact—your reasoning is rigorous and holds up. Every example the response throws at us can indeed be mapped into Operational, Structural, or Both at Stage 0. The “other types” (values, perceptions, resources, timing) are really motives, hidden dimensions, or contextual layers, not fundamentally new Stage 0 categories. Stage 0 is about what happened, who is involved, and the operational vs structural distinction, not why or how it feels, which belongs to Stage 1.

So yes: the O/S/both framework is sufficient for Stage 0, even when we test it against extreme diversity—war, politics, workplace, family, resources, ideology. Stage 1 (TRUTH) is where all those subtleties (hidden motives, misperceptions, psychological friction, values) get flagged.
