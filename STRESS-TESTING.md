## 4.1 Stress Test: Competing Legitimate Goods


1. stories, symbols 

Classic fables:
	∙	Two goats on a bridge - neither will yield, both fall off. The prank: everyone gets a tiny goat.
	∙	Dog with a bone seeing its reflection, fighting itself. Mirror reveal in the trunk.
Trickster tales:
	∙	Coyote stories - he always thinks he’s winning until the joke’s on him
	∙	Anansi the spider - weaves everyone into his trick
	∙	Raven - steals the sun/light, chaos follows
Visual paradoxes:
	∙	Duck-rabbit illusion - “Which do you see?” Both sides are right. Both sides are wrong.
	∙	The impossible triangle - the conflict can’t actually exist
	∙	Yin-yang - you can’t remove one side without destroying both
Religious absurdity:
	∙	Tower of Babel - suddenly no one understands anyone
	∙	Solomon’s baby - threaten to cut it in half, truth emerges
The Sneetches - stars on, stars off, until nobody remembers what the fight was about

The Stories & Symbols:
	∙	Two goats on a bridge (neither yields, both fall)
	∙	Dog fighting its own reflection
	∙	Coyote trickster tales
	∙	Anansi the spider
	∙	Raven steals the sun
	∙	Duck-rabbit illusion
	∙	Impossible triangle
	∙	Yin-yang
	∙	Tower of Babel
	∙	Solomon’s baby
	∙	The Sneetches (stars on/off)
	∙	Rabbit flags (your image)
What they all have in common:
The conflict destroys itself. Or never existed in the first place.
Either:
	1.	Fighting yourself - the enemy is you, a reflection, an illusion
	2.	Fighting over nothing - the distinction was meaningless all along
	3.	The trickster laughs - someone orchestrated the conflict to expose its stupidity
	4.	Both sides lose by winning - the victory is the defeat
The deepest thread: the resolution isn’t compromise or victory - it’s realizing the frame was wrong.
You don’t solve the goat problem by one goat winning. You solve it by not being on that bridge. Or by realizing you’re both goats.

**Scenario:** Two parents in a divorce both want primary custody. Neither has done anything wrong. Both love the child. Both are good parents.

| Stage | What happens |
|-------|--------------|
| **Map** | Conflict is over custody. Parties: Parent A, Parent B, Child. |
| **Check** | Both say they want primary custody. Both do care for the child well. Both want time and stability. **Clash:** Both want something only one can fully have. |
| **Judgment** | Violated? No — no rules broken. Concealed? No — both are honest. **Ignored?** Yes — each party's legitimate need is at risk of being dismissed by the other's claim. **Verdict:** Someone's needs will be unmet. The child may be caught in the middle. |
| **Decision** | Choose a resolution that addresses the consequences — shared custody, specific arrangements, compromise. |
| **Action** | Implement it. |

**Conclusion:** The framework works. "Ignored" captures legitimate needs at risk of being unmet — even when no one is at fault. Consequences exist even without wrongdoing. The cost of the impasse is real.

DO NOT READ -NEEDS RE-THINKING/EDITING

What could be the most horrible - outrageous - the most disgusting - the most "no way" test we could put this framework though? 

## 4.2 Stress Test: Latent and Future Conflict

**Question:** Can this framework handle latent conflict (tension that hasn't erupted) or future conflict (anticipated)?

**Answer:** Yes. The Time dimension (Past, Present, Future) explicitly covers this:

- **Future mode:** Your map is a hypothesis. You are simulating, not resolving. You can Map, project Check, prepare Judgment, rehearse Decision — but Action is not yet possible. Simulation is preparation, not resolution.
- **Latent conflict:** If tension exists but consequences cannot be named, it's either not yet a conflict worth resolving, or you haven't looked hard enough. The framework prompts deeper investigation.

## 4.3 Stress Test: The Bad Actor

**Question:** What if the other party is actively gaming the framework?

*[PLACEHOLDER: To be developed — addresses strategic misrepresentation, exaggerated costs, manipulation]*

## 4.4 Stress Test: The Asymmetry of Power

**Question:** What if a child fights a parent, or a citizen fights a state?

*[PLACEHOLDER: To be developed — addresses structural vs operational distinction, power imbalance]*

## 4.5 Stress Test: The Irreversible Past

**Question:** How do you apply Action when damage cannot be undone?

*[PLACEHOLDER: To be developed — addresses the Gaps audit when repair is impossible]*



PART 4: STRESS TESTING

Purpose of Stress Testing in General
Ukraine, Gaza, Cookie, ? https://www.youtube.com/@ProfJiangExplains/videos

**The Hardest Test**

In Gaza, you'd have layers of self-deception operating simultaneously: individual stories people tell themselves to survive, collective narratives that justify actions, political stories that maintain power structures. But you'd also have genuine trauma, real powerlessness, and structural oppression.

Let me be clear: structural injustice is real. Power asymmetries are real. When a state bombs civilians, when systems grind people down, when violence is one-sided—that's not projection. That's not mirror-fighting. I'm not asking you to pretend oppression is a mindset problem.

What I am asking is different and more modest: given the structural reality you cannot currently change, what stories are you telling yourself about what's possible? Are those stories serving your survival, or are they foreclosing options you haven't yet seen?

That's not the same as saying "both sides." It's saying: even when one side holds the guns, you still get to examine what's happening in your own mind. Not because it's fair. Because it's the only territory you actually control.

Maybe the question isn't whether people in Gaza are "full of shit." Maybe it's about which stories serve survival versus which ones perpetuate the cycle. Some self-deception might be psychologically necessary for people under siege, while other narratives keep the conflict locked in place.

This is exactly what makes people squirm. The idea that even in the most extreme suffering, there might still be elements of self-deception mixed in with legitimate grievance and trauma.

This framework does the impossible—it risks adding to your load. Adding more harm to people already carrying unbearable weight. They're already so broken, so hungry, and now they must admit to their own "shit"?

But if the ultimate goal is ending the conflict, then every story that perpetuates it becomes fair game to examine, no matter how justified it feels.

I'm not talking about who's responsible for ending wars or dismantling systems. That's macro-responsibility, and it's distributed according to power. The people with the most power have the most responsibility to change the structure.

I'm talking about micro-agency: the small territory of your own perception, your own reactions, your own stories. That's what this framework addresses. Not because it's sufficient—it isn't—but because it's yours.

So even in Gaza, there might be stories on all sides that serve emotional needs but prevent resolution. "They'll never change." "This is who they are." "We have no choice." Narratives that might feel true but actually close off possibilities for different outcomes.

The brutal question becomes: are you more attached to your story about why the conflict continues, or to actually ending it? Even when your story contains real truth about injustice and suffering?

That's where it gets maximally uncomfortable—asking people to examine whether their most cherished beliefs about their situation might be part of what keeps them trapped in it. Not dismissing the reality of their experience, but questioning which parts of their interpretation serve freedom versus which parts serve the continuation of the pattern.
after all that rigor, you discover the conflict was as stupid as arguing over whose rabbit is correct.
