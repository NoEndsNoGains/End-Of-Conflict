## 4.1 Stress Test: Competing Legitimate Goods


1. stories, symbols 

Classic fables:
	∙	Two goats on a bridge - neither will yield, both fall off. The prank: everyone gets a tiny goat.
	∙	Dog with a bone seeing its reflection, fighting itself. Mirror reveal in the trunk.
Trickster tales:
	∙	Coyote stories - he always thinks he’s winning until the joke’s on him
	∙	Anansi the spider - weaves everyone into his trick
	∙	Raven - steals the sun/light, chaos follows
Visual paradoxes:
	∙	Duck-rabbit illusion - “Which do you see?” Both sides are right. Both sides are wrong.
	∙	The impossible triangle - the conflict can’t actually exist
	∙	Yin-yang - you can’t remove one side without destroying both
Religious absurdity:
	∙	Tower of Babel - suddenly no one understands anyone
	∙	Solomon’s baby - threaten to cut it in half, truth emerges
The Sneetches - stars on, stars off, until nobody remembers what the fight was about

The Stories & Symbols:
	∙	Two goats on a bridge (neither yields, both fall)
	∙	Dog fighting its own reflection
	∙	Coyote trickster tales
	∙	Anansi the spider
	∙	Raven steals the sun
	∙	Duck-rabbit illusion
	∙	Impossible triangle
	∙	Yin-yang
	∙	Tower of Babel
	∙	Solomon’s baby
	∙	The Sneetches (stars on/off)
	∙	Rabbit flags (your image)
What they all have in common:
The conflict destroys itself. Or never existed in the first place.
Either:
	1.	Fighting yourself - the enemy is you, a reflection, an illusion
	2.	Fighting over nothing - the distinction was meaningless all along
	3.	The trickster laughs - someone orchestrated the conflict to expose its stupidity
	4.	Both sides lose by winning - the victory is the defeat
The deepest thread: the resolution isn’t compromise or victory - it’s realizing the frame was wrong.
You don’t solve the goat problem by one goat winning. You solve it by not being on that bridge. Or by realizing you’re both goats.

ScaleStoriesInside (the war in you)The Shadow (Jung), Hamlet's paralysis, Arjuna's crisis in the Bhagavad Gita, Dr Jekyll & Mr Hyde, the Two WolvesBetween (you and someone else)Cain & Abel, Jacob & Esau, Gilgamesh & Enkidu, the Frog Prince, Medea & JasonBeyond (the war in the world)The Iliad, Ragnarök, The Oresteia (blood feud → courts), Animal Farm, 1984, Montagues & Capulets

4.3 The Five Tests
TestWhat it stress-testsStoriesNo Villain (both sides are right)Can the framework hold when there's no bad guy?Antigone (moral law vs. state law), The Prodigal Son (both sons have legitimate grievance), Solomon's Judgement (before truth revealed), King Lear (Cordelia's honesty vs. Lear's need), custody disputes with two good parentsThe Liar (one side is gaming it)Can the framework survive bad faith?The Wolf and the Lamb, Animal Farm's pigs, Iago, Rumpelstiltskin (bargains under duress), Br'er Rabbit/Bugs Bunny (justified trickster?)The Weaker (power is unequal)Can the framework work when one side can't be heard?David & Goliath, Horton Hears a Who, Watership Down's Efrafa, The Handmaid's Tale, any trapped-protagonist storyThe Broken (damage can't be undone)Can the framework address the irreversible?Medea (children dead), Oedipus (truth known, eyes gone), King Lear (Cordelia dead), Humpty Dumpty, Urashima Tarō (time passed)The Unborn (hasn't happened yet)Can the framework work on hypotheticals?Sleeping Beauty's curse, Joseph's dreams, prophecy narratives, pre-emptive conflict

What This Does
Each story becomes a worked example that tests whether the framework holds under that specific strain:

4.3.1 No Villain Test
Antigone — Antigone must bury her brother (divine law). Creon must enforce the state's decree (civil law). Both are right. Neither can yield without betraying what they are.
Run the framework:

MAP: Two parties, one corpse, incompatible obligations
CHECK: What does each say/do/want/hide/miss?
JUDGE: What's violated? Divine law OR civil law—depending on your frame. The framework can't tell you which frame is correct.
DECIDE: What solution prevents return? There isn't one. The tragedy is that the framework reveals the impossibility.
ACT: Antigone acts (buries). Creon acts (punishes). Both die.

What the test reveals: The framework doesn't promise resolution. It promises sight. Sometimes sight shows you there is no exit—only which death you choose.










**Scenario:** Two parents in a divorce both want primary custody. Neither has done anything wrong. Both love the child. Both are good parents.

| Stage | What happens |
|-------|--------------|
| **Map** | Conflict is over custody. Parties: Parent A, Parent B, Child. |
| **Check** | Both say they want primary custody. Both do care for the child well. Both want time and stability. **Clash:** Both want something only one can fully have. |
| **Judgment** | Violated? No — no rules broken. Concealed? No — both are honest. **Ignored?** Yes — each party's legitimate need is at risk of being dismissed by the other's claim. **Verdict:** Someone's needs will be unmet. The child may be caught in the middle. |
| **Decision** | Choose a resolution that addresses the consequences — shared custody, specific arrangements, compromise. |
| **Action** | Implement it. |

**Conclusion:** The framework works. "Ignored" captures legitimate needs at risk of being unmet — even when no one is at fault. Consequences exist even without wrongdoing. The cost of the impasse is real.

DO NOT READ -NEEDS RE-THINKING/EDITING

What could be the most horrible - outrageous - the most disgusting - the most "no way" test we could put this framework though? 

## 4.2 Stress Test: Latent and Future Conflict

**Question:** Can this framework handle latent conflict (tension that hasn't erupted) or future conflict (anticipated)?

**Answer:** Yes. The Time dimension (Past, Present, Future) explicitly covers this:

- **Future mode:** Your map is a hypothesis. You are simulating, not resolving. You can Map, project Check, prepare Judgment, rehearse Decision — but Action is not yet possible. Simulation is preparation, not resolution.
- **Latent conflict:** If tension exists but consequences cannot be named, it's either not yet a conflict worth resolving, or you haven't looked hard enough. The framework prompts deeper investigation.

## 4.3 Stress Test: The Bad Actor

**Question:** What if the other party is actively gaming the framework?

*[PLACEHOLDER: To be developed — addresses strategic misrepresentation, exaggerated costs, manipulation]*

## 4.4 Stress Test: The Asymmetry of Power

**Question:** What if a child fights a parent, or a citizen fights a state?

*[PLACEHOLDER: To be developed — addresses structural vs operational distinction, power imbalance]*

## 4.5 Stress Test: The Irreversible Past

**Question:** How do you apply Action when damage cannot be undone?

*[PLACEHOLDER: To be developed — addresses the Gaps audit when repair is impossible]*



PART 4: STRESS TESTING

Purpose of Stress Testing in General
Ukraine, Gaza, Cookie, ? https://www.youtube.com/@ProfJiangExplains/videos

**The Hardest Test**

In Gaza, you'd have layers of self-deception operating simultaneously: individual stories people tell themselves to survive, collective narratives that justify actions, political stories that maintain power structures. But you'd also have genuine trauma, real powerlessness, and structural oppression.

Let me be clear: structural injustice is real. Power asymmetries are real. When a state bombs civilians, when systems grind people down, when violence is one-sided—that's not projection. That's not mirror-fighting. I'm not asking you to pretend oppression is a mindset problem.

What I am asking is different and more modest: given the structural reality you cannot currently change, what stories are you telling yourself about what's possible? Are those stories serving your survival, or are they foreclosing options you haven't yet seen?

That's not the same as saying "both sides." It's saying: even when one side holds the guns, you still get to examine what's happening in your own mind. Not because it's fair. Because it's the only territory you actually control.

Maybe the question isn't whether people in Gaza are "full of shit." Maybe it's about which stories serve survival versus which ones perpetuate the cycle. Some self-deception might be psychologically necessary for people under siege, while other narratives keep the conflict locked in place.

This is exactly what makes people squirm. The idea that even in the most extreme suffering, there might still be elements of self-deception mixed in with legitimate grievance and trauma.

This framework does the impossible—it risks adding to your load. Adding more harm to people already carrying unbearable weight. They're already so broken, so hungry, and now they must admit to their own "shit"?

But if the ultimate goal is ending the conflict, then every story that perpetuates it becomes fair game to examine, no matter how justified it feels.

I'm not talking about who's responsible for ending wars or dismantling systems. That's macro-responsibility, and it's distributed according to power. The people with the most power have the most responsibility to change the structure.

I'm talking about micro-agency: the small territory of your own perception, your own reactions, your own stories. That's what this framework addresses. Not because it's sufficient—it isn't—but because it's yours.

So even in Gaza, there might be stories on all sides that serve emotional needs but prevent resolution. "They'll never change." "This is who they are." "We have no choice." Narratives that might feel true but actually close off possibilities for different outcomes.

The brutal question becomes: are you more attached to your story about why the conflict continues, or to actually ending it? Even when your story contains real truth about injustice and suffering?

That's where it gets maximally uncomfortable—asking people to examine whether their most cherished beliefs about their situation might be part of what keeps them trapped in it. Not dismissing the reality of their experience, but questioning which parts of their interpretation serve freedom versus which parts serve the continuation of the pattern.
after all that rigor, you discover the conflict was as stupid as arguing over whose rabbit is correct.

The Good Jew
Michael Inzlicht
Jan 7
 




READ IN APP
 
My life changed irrevocably two years ago. And I am far from alone.

Upgrade to paid
Nearly every Jew I know—no matter their political beliefs or ideological commitments—has had to reckon with how their ethnic/religious/cultural group is now perceived. For many like me, this is a new thing.

I didn’t know it at the time, but I grew up in a golden age of Jew tolerance, where Jew hatred was something I learned about from dusty textbooks or my father’s and uncle’s stories of Living While Jewish in Europe. Sure, I witnessed some acts of hate—in 1987, my synagogue in suburban Montreal was graffitied with swastikas and the phrase “Burn Jews”—but this was the exception. I never thought my Judaism made a lick of difference in how I was treated.

That carefree sense of psychological (and even physical) safety is no longer. The god damned plane has crashed into the mountain. I got a taste for this on October 8th, 2023, when demonstrators on the streets and campuses of North America’s finest cities were telling Jews to go back to Poland. But nothing could prepare me for what was to come.

Over the past two years, Jews around the world have been ostracized, vandalized, shot at, poisoned, and murdered. I could list incident after incident. The Jewish schools shot at multiple times, the shops set ablaze, the mezuzahs ripped from doors, the families attacked in their homes. After a while they blur together, which is its own horror.

The one I can’t shake is Bondi Beach, Australia. Fifteen Jews hunted and massacred while they gathered for family fun on the beach celebrating Hannukah. How ordinary the day must have started for them. Coffee, maybe. Latkes. And then.

The collective response from non-Jews has typically been thoughts and prayers. Governments will say antisemitism has no place in Canada or the UK or Australia, but hardly anything is ever done. These are the sympathetic responses, mind you. You’ll also see responses that obfuscate, minimize, or deny—folks weren’t murdered because they were Jewish but because they were Zionists; this was a false-flag operation carried out by the Mossad. Some people even hold Jews responsible for the hate directed at them: Jews have it coming to them because of what is happening in the Middle East.

If you are Jewish and reading this, none of this is new. Maybe you don’t pay attention to all the latest incidents, but you know your bubby and zaida are scared. Maybe you don’t do what I do—doomscroll through the latest incidents of Jew hatred each night before bed—but you’re aware that you are (again) one of the world’s bad guys.

So, this post is not for you, fellow Heebs. This one’s for the gentiles.

Before unloading my feelings, let me say that I find writing this whole thing cringe. Not because my feelings aren’t valid, but because I hate the idea of being that Jew, the Jew that complains about antisemitism. I used to make fun of paranoid Jews, those who saw antisemitism hiding in every dark corner. Sometimes I still think my fellow Jews are paranoid, seeing everything through antisemitism-tinted glasses. But, at other times, I see how folks contort themselves to excuse hateful behaviour as anything other than antisemitic. For example, when a Jewish family was harassed at the Toronto Zoo simply for being Jewish, some commenters on Reddit wondered if the family brought this upon themselves not because of anything they said or did but because of their implied political views.

I don’t want to speak for other Jews, only for myself, but I know of only a few Jews whose lives have been unchanged. Those on the political right look in horror as some in the MAGA coalition breathe new life to ancient antisemitic tropes. Fearing for their physical safety, this has led to a surge in gun ownership among American Jews, a group with almost no gun culture. I have even met Canadian Jews who are considering moving to the US because they believe they’re safer there than here. Some American Jewish communities have even set up programs to help Canadian Jews relocate.

But it is the more numerous Jews on the political left whose lives have really been upended. Given my own center-left leaning and my job as a university professor, many of the folks I work with or live near are liberals or far-left progressives. And given that being anti-Israel is the omnicause for progressives—destroy Israel and, like the Death Star, all the world’s problems disappear—this has made my life and the life of other left-leaning Jews more challenging.

It mostly happened in little ways, but I can’t help but notice how I have been othered. A few summers ago, I was speaking to an old friend about my daughter, but as soon as I mentioned her bat-mitzvah, my friend froze, clearly uncomfortable. He then said that despite having attended a few bar- and bat-mitzvahs in his youth, the idea of attending a Jewish rite of passage felt different to him now. To my dear friend, a progressive university professor in the US, celebrating Jewish religious rituals now felt fraught, even political. I recoiled in disgust.

This othering has been uncomfortable, yes, but it has also been frightening. My family and I are now worried for our physical safety. I told my daughter, who wears a Star of David necklace, to hide it in public. My father—an observant Jew—no longer walks in public with a yarmulke but hides it under a hat. When people ask me where I’m really from, I say that while my father is from Belgium, my mother’s family hails from Yemen. What I don’t tell them is that my mother’s family were refugees from Yemen who settled in what eventually became Israel. To be clear, I am more comfortable claiming my Yemeni heritage than my Israeli one. This despite Yemen’s decade-long civil war having killed, starved, and displaced more people than the entirety of the Israel-Palestine conflict. I’m more comfortable because Yemen is not seen as the source of all the world’s problems.

I’m ashamed of myself for my cowardice. How could I tell my daughter to push down her Jewish pride? Why am I scared to tell people my octogenarian mom is Israeli?

I’m doing what so many Jews have done throughout our history: hiding parts of myself. I realize that to be accepted by my non-Jewish peers, I need to be a “good jew,” pushing back those parts of myself that are considered vulgar. Generations ago, being a “good Jew” might have meant dressing, eating, or worshipping differently to fit in. Today, many young and progressive Jews need to have the correct political attitudes—read, anti-Zionism—to be “good Jews” and thus acceptable in progressive circles. They’re being asked to renounce their belief in Jewish self-determination if they want to be seen as fully human.

While some Jews indeed do this, don’t let the prominent featuring of anti-Israel Jews in news stories fool you into thinking this is a mainstream view. Only 6% of Canadian Jews reject Israel as a Jewish state; just 1% identify as anti-Zionist[1]. What’s actually happened is the opposite: the rise of what some call October 8th Jews—those of us who woke up the day after the massacre to find our supposed allies celebrating or silent. Many of us have reconnected with our Jewish identities. I’m no exception. My family and I now hold a regular shabbat dinner. We have attended community Passover and Hannukah celebrations. We are more selective about our friendships, feeling particularly comfortable around other Jews.


So, what do I want from you, my non-Jewish friends, colleagues, neighbours?

I don’t want you to become Zionists. I don’t want you to change your politics or your views on the conflict in the Middle East. I’m not asking for agreement.

I’m asking you to see me. To understand that when you stay silent about Jewish shops being firebombed or Jewish schools being shot at, that silence lands on my doorstep.

I’m asking you to hold two thoughts in your head at once: that Palestinians are suffering and that Jews are suffering too. Both things can be true.

Most of all, I’m asking you not to make me earn my humanity by having the right politics. For the vast majority of us, Jewish identity is inseparable from Israel. Not its government or policies, but the idea of a Jewish homeland, a place of refuge. Asking us to renounce that to be accepted is asking us to amputate part of ourselves.

I realize this is a lot to ask. Maybe too much. But I’ve hidden parts of myself for long enough. My father shouldn’t have to hide his yarmulke under a hat. My daughter shouldn’t have to tuck away her Star of David. And maybe, just maybe, I shouldn’t have to think twice before telling you where my mother is from.

[1] While 94% of Canadian Jews support Israel’s right to exist as a Jewish state, only 55% call themselves Zionists. The discrepancy likely reflects how toxic the word Zionism has become rather than any actual opposition to a Jewish homeland. This interpretation is supported by the fact that 84% of Canadian Jews report feeling emotionally attached to Israel, while a mere 1% identify as anti-Zionist.
