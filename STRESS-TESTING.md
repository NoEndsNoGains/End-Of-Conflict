**The Hardest Test**

In Gaza, you'd have layers of self-deception operating simultaneously: individual stories people tell themselves to survive, collective narratives that justify actions, political stories that maintain power structures. But you'd also have genuine trauma, real powerlessness, and structural oppression.

Let me be clear: structural injustice is real. Power asymmetries are real. When a state bombs civilians, when systems grind people down, when violence is one-sided—that's not projection. That's not mirror-fighting. I'm not asking you to pretend oppression is a mindset problem.

What I am asking is different and more modest: given the structural reality you cannot currently change, what stories are you telling yourself about what's possible? Are those stories serving your survival, or are they foreclosing options you haven't yet seen?

That's not the same as saying "both sides." It's saying: even when one side holds the guns, you still get to examine what's happening in your own mind. Not because it's fair. Because it's the only territory you actually control.

Maybe the question isn't whether people in Gaza are "full of shit." Maybe it's about which stories serve survival versus which ones perpetuate the cycle. Some self-deception might be psychologically necessary for people under siege, while other narratives keep the conflict locked in place.

This is exactly what makes people squirm. The idea that even in the most extreme suffering, there might still be elements of self-deception mixed in with legitimate grievance and trauma.

This framework does the impossible—it risks adding to your load. Adding more harm to people already carrying unbearable weight. They're already so broken, so hungry, and now they must admit to their own "shit"?

But if the ultimate goal is ending the conflict, then every story that perpetuates it becomes fair game to examine, no matter how justified it feels.

I'm not talking about who's responsible for ending wars or dismantling systems. That's macro-responsibility, and it's distributed according to power. The people with the most power have the most responsibility to change the structure.

I'm talking about micro-agency: the small territory of your own perception, your own reactions, your own stories. That's what this framework addresses. Not because it's sufficient—it isn't—but because it's yours.

So even in Gaza, there might be stories on all sides that serve emotional needs but prevent resolution. "They'll never change." "This is who they are." "We have no choice." Narratives that might feel true but actually close off possibilities for different outcomes.

The brutal question becomes: are you more attached to your story about why the conflict continues, or to actually ending it? Even when your story contains real truth about injustice and suffering?

That's where it gets maximally uncomfortable—asking people to examine whether their most cherished beliefs about their situation might be part of what keeps them trapped in it. Not dismissing the reality of their experience, but questioning which parts of their interpretation serve freedom versus which parts serve the continuation of the pattern.
