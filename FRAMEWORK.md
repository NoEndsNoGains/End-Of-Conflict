## EAGLE — MAPs

### Eagle Maps the Terrain

*Because you cannot navigate a field you haven't named.*

**Questions Eagle asks:**

- What's the conflict? (the big name)
- Who are the parties? Am I a party?
- What are the battlefields? (the specific friction points)
- Who is fighting on each battlefield? Are both parties there — or did one leave and declare the war over?
- What is fog? (cannot see — too heavy to move)
- What is flood? (too much — cannot think)
- What is forbidden? (told not to fly there — and by whom?)
- What is beyond the horizon? (exists, affects the field, but outside current view)

*Focus is not on the "True." Focus is on the "Entire."*

Eagle flies at 10,000 feet. It doesn't verify yet — that is Bloodhound's job. Eagle looks for the boundaries. (These boundaries can be wrong. That's why Bloodhound comes next.)

Eagle has two enemies:

**Fog** — cannot see. Information is hidden or inaccessible. What's happening in the other household. How the institution decides. What they actually want.

**Flood** — cannot think. Too much, all at once. Six years of history. Every issue connected to every other. Can't tell what matters from what doesn't.

Eagle blows fog away to reveal. Eagle drains flood to focus. The "World-Ending War" becomes specific disputes over specific boundaries.

Not all parties announce themselves. Eagle looks for the Hidden Player: the mother-in-law who isn't in the room but is in the conversation; the boss who hasn't spoken but whose rules must be obeyed.

---

### Eagle adapts to the terrain

Not all conflicts look the same.

- **When the conflict has multiple names:** "War" vs "Special Operation." "Parental dispute" vs "Mother's control issues." Note all names — each name reveals a position. This is data for Bloodhound. And check: which name do YOU use? That reveals your position too.

- **When one party denies the conflict:** They may call it "a process," "a determination," "a boundary," or "proof of your problem." What they call it instead is data. If one party says "there is no conflict" — that itself is data.

- **When you're fighting alone:** You see a battlefield. They don't. They decided and left. Your fighting is what THEY call the problem — not the issue itself.

- **When a party has no face:** Institutions, systems, policies, internalized voices. Ask: Who specifically has authority? Who made the rule? Who enforces it? Who benefits from it staying unchanged?

- **When both parties agree on facts but not meaning:** Same friction point, opposite interpretation. "Yes, you want to write" / "Yes, writing is selfish." "Yes, I have authority" / "Yes, but not without consulting me." Same map, different legends. Map both meanings.

- **When one party wants recognition, the other offers process:** These cannot meet on the same level. Name the gap.

- **When the conflict is internal:** All parties are you. Fog is thicker. The horizon may be drawn by an internalized other. You are the battlefield.

- **When fog is heaviest:** You are inside what you're examining. Internal conflicts, long-standing disputes, and fights with powerful institutions all have heavier fog — because you cannot step outside to see the whole.

- **When the horizon was drawn by someone else:** A parent whose voice you internalized, a contract you signed, a court that ruled, a system that set the frame. Ask: Who benefits from where the horizon sits? Did I accept a map before Eagle flew?

- **When something is forbidden:** Note whose forbidden it is. One party's "irrelevant" is another party's "central." The West treats NATO's role in 2008-2014 as closed; Russia treats Ukrainian agency as non-existent. Both are "forbidden zones" — but for different parties.

### Eagle checks Eagle

*Check your Coordinate Card. Your coordinates predict where you cheated.*

| Your Coordinate | How it corrupts Eagle | The Catch Question |
|-----------------|----------------------|-------------------|
| **WANT** | You mapped toward your win | Did I map what THEY want as carefully as what I want? |
| **FEAR** | You erased what terrifies you | Did I map what I'm afraid to see? |
| **GAME** | You hid your own moves | Did I map my own strategy as a feature of the terrain? |
| **BLIND SPOT** | You flattened what you don't want to see | Did I map the parts that make me look bad? |
| **HORIZON** | You stopped at what you can't see | Did I mark where my vision ends — and ask what's beyond it? |

**The Master Question:**
> If someone with opposite coordinates mapped this conflict, what would THEY see that I missed?

**The Meta Question:**
> Can I guess the other parties' coordinates? Their WANT, FEAR, GAME, BLIND SPOT, HORIZON? If I can't — I haven't mapped them. I've only mapped my story about them.

**The Shadow Check:**
- Am I an Eagle or a Vulture? *(Vulture only circles for carcasses — hunting the other's faults, not mapping the whole)*
- Who gave me this job? Who told me where the horizon ends?

---

*Eagle passes the map to Bloodhound.*

---

## BLOODHOUND — CHECKs

### Bloodhound Checks what Eagle Maps

*Because what is seen isn't always what's true.*

Bloodhound sniffs the specific battlefields Eagle mapped. It doesn't look at the whole field; it puts its nose to the ground at the boundaries.

**Eagle passes the map. Bloodhound verifies:**

- The battlefields — are they real, or only claimed?
- The parties — including hidden players
- The names — strip the label. What is the physical action taking place?
- The forbidden zones — what specific facts exist where Eagle was told not to fly?
- The "one party left" claim — did they leave, or just change how they fight?

**For each party (including yourself), Bloodhound asks:**

- What do they say? What do they do?
- What do they want? What are they hiding?
- What are they missing? What don't they want to see?
- What did they omit? (The silent action that changed the scent)

*Because we all Say, Do, Want, Hide, Miss, Omit, and Avoid — no exception.*

---

### Bloodhound works the terrain

Bloodhound doesn't care about your story. It doesn't care who is the hero or who is the villain. It treats narrative as a scent trail that often leads AWAY from the action trail.

**If Eagle says "There is fog here"** — Bloodhound doesn't just look at the fog. It walks into it and feels for the furniture. It asks for specifics:
- Not "They are aggressive" — but "They sent three emails after 9 PM"
- Not "I am supportive" — but "I haven't replied to their request in four days"

**If Eagle says "They call it X, we call it Y"** — Bloodhound strips the perfume of the label to find the sweat of the action:
- Regardless of the name: Are tanks crossing? Are people being fired? Are voices being raised?

**If Eagle says "This is forbidden"** — Bloodhound sticks its nose right into that zone:
- What specifically happened there that makes the scent so strong?
- Who decided it was forbidden? What are they protecting?

**If Eagle says "One party left the battlefield"** — Bloodhound checks:
- What are they actually doing now?
- Did they leave, or just change weapons?

---

### Bloodhound's enemy

Not malice. The **Preferred Scent**.

The scent you prefer — the one that confirms your story, the one that makes you right — that scent is the one most likely to mislead you.

If you find a fact that makes you look good, sniff it twice. It might be a decoy.

---

### Bloodhound checks Bloodhound

*Check your Coordinate Card. Your coordinates predict where your nose lied.*

| Your Coordinate | How it corrupts Bloodhound | The Catch Question |
|-----------------|---------------------------|-------------------|
| **WANT** | You sniffed only for confirming scents | Did I follow trails that contradict my preferred outcome? |
| **FEAR** | You avoided trails that scare you | Did I sniff where I was afraid to go? |
| **GAME** | You didn't sniff your own trail | Did I verify what I SAY vs what I DO as rigorously as I checked them? |
| **BLIND SPOT** | You called your preferred scent "neutral" | Did I notice when I stopped sniffing because I liked what I found? |
| **HORIZON** | You didn't track what happened outside your view | Did I note what I CANNOT verify — and mark it as unknown? |

**The Master Question:**
> If Bloodhound worked for the other party, what scent would they find on ME?

**The Meta Question:**
> What do THEY say, do, want, hide, miss? Can I answer this as precisely as I answered it for myself? If not — I'm sniffing with one nostril.

**The Shadow Check:**
- Am I a Bloodhound or an Inquisitor? *(Inquisitor uses facts as weapons to trap, not trails to follow)*
- Is my nose clogged by my own story?

---

> **Note:** Bloodhound's sniff is descriptive, not evaluative. That's Owl's job.
>
> Bloodhound finds the trail for both sides of the line. This is where the ice-cold begins: you must smell your own tracks as clearly as theirs.

---

*Bloodhound passes the raw scent to Owl.*

---

Check yourself:
You just finished Bloodhound. Your current state is:

a) The Overachiever: "Eagle maps. Bloodhound sniffs. And??"
b) The Skeptic: "Is this an elaborate way to tell me I'm a jerk?"
c) The Zoo-Goer: "How many animals are left? I was told there would be an Ant."
d) The Scroller: Stopped reading. Just here for the goat picture.
e) The Knower: "F...k. I knew she won't let go. She wrote about me — that little Beach."

The Verdict: If you picked d, Bloodhound saw you skip the Omissions section. He's not mad — he's just a dog. He's passing you to Owl. She doesn't blink, and she's currently weighing your soul. If you picked e — you're right. See "Right vs. Free" in _The Monsters_.

> **Note:** To Poets
> I owe an apology to everyone who ever wrote real poetry and didn't trade it for jokes and pictures of goats. I didn't have a choice. The work only works if people read it. And this — the quizzes, the goats, the "beach" — is what makes people read. Forgive me. Or
> don't. You're probably still on page one, being beautiful. And yes, I like "Notes." See _Legal Disclaimer_.

## OWL — JUDGEs

### Owl Judges what Bloodhound Reports

*Because truth needs a verdict to become useful.*

Eagle passes the map. Bloodhound passes the verified scent. Owl sits on the branch and watches both. Owl's job is to assign weight.

**Questions Owl asks to reach a verdict:**

- Is there anything to judge? (threshold — sometimes the scent leads nowhere)
- What was violated? (broken rules, betrayed trust, ignored boundaries)
- What was concealed? (the motives, the Hidden Player's influence, the self-deceptions)
- What was ignored? (the needs that weren't met, the fears that drove the action)
- What was omitted? (the silence that spoke — by all parties, including you)
- What is the consequence? (if this continues, where does the trail end?)
- Who is accountable for what? (all parties — including you)
- What requires no accountability?

*Focus is not on people. Focus is on the mechanics of the collision.*

---

### Owl turns on the lights

Owl's job isn't to be mean. It's to turn on the lights.

Sometimes the lights show you who broke the vase. Sometimes they show you the wind blew it over. Both are verdicts. You know where you stand.

But if Owl keeps its eyes shut, you're still standing in the dark, tripping over the pieces. That is the only failure.

> **Note:** Judgment is the act of assigning *weight* to information.
>
> No consequence — no verdict. If Bloodhound finds a fact but that fact has no bearing on safety, trust, or outcome, Owl lets it go. This prevents the rabbit hole — arguing over details that don't matter to resolution.

---

### Owl checks history

*Is this the first time? Or the fifth? Same dynamic, different battlefield?*

History is Owl's greatest lens. It changes the weight of every fact Bloodhound found.

A single event is an anomaly. A repeating event is a **Pattern**.

**Owl looks across Bloodhound's findings AND across time:**

- Has this happened before?
- What did we do last time? Did it stay solved, or did it just go dormant?
- If the "What" (the topic) changed but the "How" (the way we fought) stayed the same — the topic is a decoy.
- If it returned — what brought it back?

If the pattern repeats, the surface issue is not the real issue.

---

### Owl identifies the level

History reveals what level the fight is actually on.

**Level 1 — WHAT** (the substance)
The fish, the phone, the hair, the border. If solving this specific item ends the conflict forever, it was Level 1.

**Level 2 — WHO DECIDES** (the authority)
The substance was a decoy. The real fight: who has the right to make the call? If this isn't settled, every Level 1 "victory" is just a temporary truce in a power struggle.

**Level 3 — HOW TO DECIDE TOGETHER** (the process)
Authority is shared or accepted, but the way we engage is incompatible. One wants autonomy; one wants coordination. One wants recognition; the other offers policy.

Level 3 can be present even when Level 2 seems settled. One party may accept the authority but reject the process: "You have the right to decide, but not without considering my interests." This is Level 3 disguised as Level 2.

**Owl's verdict might sound like:**
> "This presents as Level 1 (territory), but history shows we've 'solved' territory three times. Therefore, this is actually a Level 3 failure — we have no agreed-upon process for sharing the field."

---

### Owl evaluates the map's gaps

Eagle mapped the fog, the flood, and the forbidden. Owl judges the meaning of those voids.

**The fog:** What does it conceal? What couldn't Bloodhound verify? Does the unknown change the verdict — or is there enough to judge?

**The flood:** If we are flooded with data, who benefits from the confusion? Is overwhelm accidental — or a tactic?

**The forbidden:** What does it cost that this zone was off-limits? Who is it protecting? Is the absence from the map itself data?

**The Hidden Player:** Is the Hidden Player (the boss, the parent, the system) the one actually setting the level of the fight?

**The horizon:** What lies beyond it that affects this conflict? Should Lion consider it — or is it outside the scope of decision?

---

### Owl's enemy

Not ignorance. The **Comfortable Verdict**.

The verdict that lets you stay the same. The verdict that blames only them. The verdict that closes the case before the case is understood.

If your verdict feels satisfying, check it twice. Comfort is suspicious.

---


### Owl checks Owl

*Check your Coordinate Card. Your coordinates predict where your verdict lied.*

| Your Coordinate | How it corrupts Owl | The Catch Question |
|-----------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| **WANT** | You weighed evidence toward your preferred verdict | Did I weigh facts that hurt my case as heavily as facts that help it? |
| **FEAR** | You rushed judgment to escape discomfort | Did I sit with uncertainty long enough — or did I close the case to feel safe? |
| **GAME** | You judged them harshly, yourself leniently | Did I apply the same standard to my violations as to theirs? |
| **BLIND SPOT** | Your verdict is comfortable | Does my verdict require ME to change? If not — check it twice. |
| **HORIZON** | You judged only what you can see | Did I account for what I cannot see — or did I pretend my view is complete? |

**The Master Question:**
> If Owl worked for the other party, what verdict would they reach about ME?

**The Meta Question:**
> What would a judge with NO coordinates — no want, no fear, no game, no blind spot — conclude? How far is my verdict from that?

**The Shadow Check:**
- Am I a wise Owl or a Critic? *(Critic judges to feel superior; wise Owl judges to find the path forward)*
- If Bloodhound found no scent on me that makes me uncomfortable, I may be a goat wearing Owl's feathers.

---

> **Note:** Owl can be honest about your own role because your Ego is already accounted for. You are turning on the lights to solve the problem, not to shame the self. The goal is clarity, not punishment.

---

### The handoff

Owl does not decide what to do. Owl provides the diagnosis.

*Owl delivers verdict, history, pattern, level, and the meaning of the gaps to Lion.*
---

## LION — DECIDEs

### Lion Decides on what Owl Diagnosed

*Because a verdict isn't a solution. The problem remains until someone changes the field.*

Owl turned on the lights. Lion sees the root, the pattern, and the level. But seeing isn't deciding. And deciding to cut a branch when Owl showed you the root is not a solution — it is postponement.

> **Note:** Judgment (Owl) is backward — what happened, what it cost. Decision (Lion) is forward — what to do about the problem.
>
> Owl may find no one did wrong. Lion still has a problem to solve.

*Focus is not on being right. Focus is on being effective.*

---

### Lion receives the diagnosis

**From Owl, Lion now holds:**

- The verdict: What was violated, concealed, ignored, omitted
- The history: First time or pattern? What happened last time?
- The level: Is this Level 1, 2, or 3?
- The gaps: What does the fog, the flood, the forbidden cost?

Lion doesn't re-investigate. Lion doesn't re-judge. Lion decides.

---

### Questions Lion asks to reach a decision

- What level am I solving for? (Am I fixing the fish, the authority, or the process?)
- Does this break the pattern? (Or am I just "getting through" this instance so it can return in six months?)
- What is the move? (What is the specific, physical action I will take?)
- What is the cost of the move? (And am I willing to pay it?)
- What is the cost of no move? (The "tax" of letting the pattern repeat.)

---

### Lion matches the move to the level

Owl identified the level. Lion responds accordingly.

**Level 1 Move — Resolve the Substance**
If it's truly just about the fish, give the fish, take the fish, or split the fish. Do it quickly and move on. If this is truly Level 1, solving it ends it. Done.

**Level 2 Move — Negotiate the Authority**
Stop fighting about the fish. Fix the "Who decides." Establish the boundary of ownership. If authority is contested, the decision must be about the *right* to choose, not the choice itself.

Questions for Level 2:
- Who currently holds the authority? Is it legitimate?
- Is the authority contested, unclear, or being undermined?
- What would settle "who decides" — agreement, boundary, or external ruling?

**Level 3 Move — Rebuild the Process**
If authority is shared but the collision is constant, the decision must be a new "How." "We both have a say, so from now on, we use X framework to decide."

Questions for Level 3:
- Can a shared process be built?
- If not — can the incompatibility be named and accepted?
- Is parallel operation possible without coordination?
- Or must this be escalated to someone with authority to impose a process?

> **Lion's Rule:** Never use a Level 1 move to solve a Level 3 problem. That is how you build a time bomb.

**Lion's hardest truth:**
> Some Level 3 conflicts cannot be resolved — only named, survived, or exited. If no shared process is possible and neither party will change their model, Lion names that. Naming the unresolvable is also a decision. "End" means the end of intractability — not necessarily a happy ending. The Lion terminates the cycle: through reconciliation, exit, or naming what cannot be resolved.

---
### Lion moves in fog

Sometimes Owl reports: "The fog is still thick. Bloodhound couldn't verify enough."

Lion still must decide — but not blindly.

**If the fog is too thick for a permanent solution** — Lion decides on a **Reconnaissance Move**: a small, reversible action designed specifically to clear the fog before the main roar.

- Not the full solution — a probe
- Designed to reveal, not to resolve
- Small enough to reverse if wrong
- Creates new data for Eagle to map

The Reconnaissance Move is still a decision. Waiting is not the same as probing.

---

### Lion considers the inaccessible

Owl may have revealed causes Lion cannot fix: another person's defences, systemic inequities, historical wounds, a party who has left the battlefield.

**Lion asks:**

- What part of this solution requires their cooperation?
- What if they don't cooperate?
- What can I do alone? (This becomes Ant's load)
- What must I name as inaccessible? (This becomes the record)

> **Note:** The full solution may exist — but you can only execute your part. Lion decides the whole answer. Ant carries your portion. What remains inaccessible is documented, not ignored.

---

### Lion's Triple Filter (The Reality Check)

Before Lion roars, the decision must pass three gates. If it fails one, it is a temporary fix that will leak.

**L.E.R — Is it right?**
- **Legal:** Does it comply with law, agreements, contracts, orders?
- **Ethical:** Can I live with myself tomorrow? Would I defend it publicly?
- **Relational:** What does this do to the long-term health of the relationship? Is that cost acceptable?

**B.U.S — Is it wise?**
- **Beneficial:** Does it actually solve the root Owl found?
- **Unintended consequences:** What might go wrong? What might it trigger? If I do this, what Hidden Player will react?
- **Sustainable:** Can I maintain this move for a year? Five years? Or does it require constant enforcement?

**A.C.T — Is it doable?**
- **Achievable:** Do I have the resources and power to do this?
- **Clear:** Could I explain this move to an Ant? Will everyone understand what it means in practice?
- **Timely:** Is now the right moment? Too early? Too late? Or is the timing the move itself?

Fails any test — not a solution. A time bomb.

---

### Lion's enemy

Not blindness. Lion already sees. Not fear. The enemy is the **Fake Peace**.

The decision that makes the room quiet today but leaves the root in the ground. The "compromise" that satisfies no one and settles nothing. The solution that protects Lion from having to change. The branch gets cut. The root grows back. Here we go again.

If your decision feels like escaping the conversation, check it twice. Escape is not a resolution.

---

### Lion checks Lion

*Check your Coordinate Card. Your coordinates predict where your decision lied.*

| Your Coordinate | How it corrupts Lion | The Catch Question |
|-----------------|----------------------|-------------------|
| **WANT** | You decided what gets you your win | Is this decision good for the CONFLICT — or just good for ME? |
| **FEAR** | You avoided decisions that face your terror | Did I avoid a better decision because it required me to face what I fear? |
| **GAME** | You decided what THEY must do, not what YOU will do | Does my decision command MY feet — or just wish for theirs? |
| **BLIND SPOT** | You chose the solution that doesn't require you to change | Does this decision let me stay the same? If yes — it's probably wrong. |
| **HORIZON** | You didn't account for forces you can't see | Did I plan for what's beyond my horizon — or will I be surprised? |

**The Master Question:**
> If Lion decided for the OTHER party, what would they decide about ME?

**The Meta Question:**
> Am I deciding to END this — or deciding to WIN this? *(They are not the same.)*

**The Shadow Check:**
- Am I a Lion or a Tyrant? *(Tyrant decides what THEY must do, not what YOU will do)*
- Does my solution require ME to change — or only them?
- Did I test all three filters: L.E.R, B.U.S, A.C.T?

---

> **Note:** Lion can only command your feet. If your solution is "they must change," that's not a decision — that's a wish. Lion decides what YOU will do, regardless of what they do.

---
### The handoff

Lion has decided. Now someone must move.

**Lion tells Ant:**

- What must you STOP doing?
- What must you START doing?
- What must you CONTINUE doing?
- What must you ACCEPT as outside your control?

*Lion roars. Ant hears.*

You just named something crucial. This could be a Note or it could be a framework for Lion — how to choose which battles to fight and how:

---

### Note on Changing Without Exposing

Some things can be changed. Some things must be swallowed. The difference isn't about importance — it's about *face*.

**The categories:**

| Issue | Can it change? | Why? |
|-------|----------------|------|
| **a) Live with** | No — accept it | Too small to fight, or too embedded to move |
| **b) Half-terms** | Yes — negotiate | Room for compromise, no one loses face |
| **c) 3:15pm** | No — swallow it | Changing it requires admitting stupidity. He won't. |
| **d) Travel section** | Yes — reframe | Can be changed if presented as clarification, not correction |

**The 3:15pm trap:**

The only way to change it is to show him how stupid it is.

But showing him how stupid it is proves you're playing him.

And if he sees you're playing him, he'll dig in forever — not because the rule is right, but because *you* tried to make him wrong.

So you can't reveal the game. You have to play it.

**The strategy:**

To change a ruling without exposing it:
- Don't say "this is wrong" — say "this could be clearer"
- Don't say "you made a mistake" — say "circumstances have changed"
- Don't say "this is stupid" — say "this creates unintended conflict"
- Give them language that sounds like their idea
- Let them be the hero of the fix

**The cost:**

You become them. You play the game. You win by playing it better, not by exposing it.

This is not justice. This is how things actually change.

The framework gives you sight to see the game. It doesn't exempt you from playing it.

**The question for Lion:**

For each issue, ask:
1. Can this change without someone losing face?
2. If not — is the ENTROPY of fighting worth more than the cost of swallowing?
3. If I fight — am I exposing or playing?
4. If I expose — will they dig in?
5. If I play — can I live with becoming them?

**Write it down:** *For each issue in this conflict: Can it change? How? At what cost to their face — and mine?*

---

Do you want this added to the Notes? Or does this belong in the Lion chapter as part of decision-making strategy?

---

## ANT — ACTs

### Ant Carries the Load

*Because a roar without a step is just noise.*

Lion has roared. The decision is made. Now Ant must pick up the load and walk.

The Ant doesn't look at the horizon. The Ant looks at the next step.

*Focus is not on the Goal. Focus is on the Step.*

---

### Ant receives the instructions

**From Lion, Ant now holds:**

- What to STOP doing
- What to START doing
- What to CONTINUE doing
- What to ACCEPT as outside your control

Ant doesn't re-decide. Ant doesn't question Lion. Ant moves.

---

### Questions Ant asks to carry the load

- What is my specific load today? (The Stop, Start, Continue, Accept)
- What is the specific, physical action? (Not "be more honest" — but "say X at the next meeting")
- When will I do it? (Not "soon" — but "Tuesday at 8am")
- Where is the friction? (Where does the old habit try to take over?)
- Is the path still clear? (Does the ground match the map Lion used?)

*Because to act is not just once — it's all the time.*

---

### Ant manages the weight

Lion gave Ant a specific load. But as Ant walks, other weights try to jump on its back.

**The Weight of the Past:** "They'll just do it again anyway."
*(Drop it. Owl already weighed history. Lion already accounted for it.)*

**The Weight of Interpretation:** "They looked at me funny when I made the move."
*(Drop it. That's perfume. Bloodhound already stripped it.)*

**The Weight of the Result:** "Is it working yet?"
*(Drop it. Ant doesn't judge the result. Ant just moves.)*

**The Weight of Resentment:** "Why do I have to be the one who changes?"
*(Drop it. Or carry it and become the Martyr.)*

> **Ant's Rule:** Carry only the Lion's command. Anything else is parasitic weight that will crush you before you reach the destination.

---

### Ant faces the friction

The world does not like it when the terrain changes. When Ant makes the move, the other parties will push back to restore the old map.

**If they ignore the move:** Ant continues the move.
**If they attack the move:** Ant continues the move.
**If they offer a "Fake Peace" to stop the move:** Ant continues the move.

The Ant doesn't argue. The Ant doesn't explain the Lion's roar. The Ant simply moves.

**If the instruction is vague** — Ant makes it concrete:
- Not "communicate better" — but "send update email every Friday"
- Not "set boundaries" — but "say no to the next request that crosses X"
- Not "let it go" — but "when the thought arrives, I will do Y instead of Z"

**If the instruction is impossible alone** — Ant carries what Ant can:
- Document what was attempted
- Note what required cooperation that didn't come
- Move your feet even if they don't move theirs

---

### Ant reports back

As Ant moves, Ant provides the feedback loop for the next cycle.

**The Obstacle:** "I am trying to do X, but Y is physically stopping me."
*(Report back to Eagle: The map was wrong.)*

**The New Data:** "Since I started doing X, they have started doing Z."
*(Report back to Bloodhound: There is a new scent.)*

**The Capacity:** "The load Lion gave me is heavier than my strength."
*(Report back to Lion: The A.C.T. filter failed.)*

---

### Ant's enemy

Not ignorance. Ant heard Lion. The enemy is the **Old Habit**.

The "I know, but..." The "I'll start tomorrow." The quiet return to what was comfortable. The slow drift back to the pattern that Lion just broke.

And behind the Old Habit hides the **Shortcut** — the moment Ant thinks it knows better than Lion and Owl. The moment Ant stops doing the small, boring work because it doesn't feel heroic.

Implementation is the graveyard of good intentions. If Ant doesn't move, Lion was just performing.

---

### Ant checks Ant

*Check your Coordinate Card. Your coordinates predict where your feet lied.*

| Your Coordinate | How it corrupts Ant | The Catch Question |
|-----------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| **WANT** | You act only when it serves your win | Am I doing the step — or waiting for a step that feels like winning? |
| **FEAR** | You freeze when action touches your terror | Am I avoiding this step because it's wrong — or because it scares me? |
| **GAME** | You perform action instead of doing it | Am I actually moving — or just looking like I'm moving? |
| **BLIND SPOT** | You revert to old habits without noticing | Have I drifted back to the pattern Lion just broke? |
| **HORIZON** | You miss obstacles you couldn't see coming | When I hit an obstacle, do I report it — or suffer in silence? |

**The Master Question:**
> If Ant worked for the other party, what step would they see ME avoiding?

**The Meta Question:**
> Am I carrying the Lion's command — or my own resentment? *(Check the weight on your back.)*

**The Shadow Check:**
- Am I an Ant, a Martyr, or a Sluggard?
  - *Martyr carries the load while resenting every grain — and uses that resentment to justify stopping*
  - *Sluggard waits for the "feeling" to move; Ant moves until the feeling follows*
- What habit am I protecting by not acting?

## EAGLE — MAPs

### Eagle Maps the Terrain

*Because you cannot navigate a field you haven't named.*

---

### What Eagle Does

Eagle flies at 10,000 feet. From up there, the "World-Ending War" becomes something nameable: specific parties, specific friction points, specific zones where sight is blocked.

Eagle doesn't verify — that's Bloodhound's job. Eagle doesn't judge — that's Owl. Eagle doesn't decide — that's Lion.

**Eagle's focus is not on the "True." Eagle's focus is on the "Entire."**

Eagle just sees the whole.

---

### Eagle's Sequence

1. **The Big Picture** — Name the conflict itself
2. **The Parties** — Who is involved (including those hidden or denied)
3. **The Battlefields** — The specific friction points within the big conflict

For each of these, Eagle notes what's VISIBLE and what's NOT — and WHY it's not visible.

---

### Why You Can't See Something

Not everything on the map is visible. When something is hidden, ask WHY:

| Reason | Definition | Example |
|--------|------------|---------|
| **FOG** | Information is hidden or inaccessible. You don't have it. | What happens in the other household. What they actually want. Who made the decision. |
| **FORBIDDEN** | Someone told you not to look there. A rule, a law, a social norm. | "The stepmother isn't a party." "Hair is day-to-day, not a PR matter." "We don't discuss 2014." |
| **HORIZON** | Outside the frame. The system won't examine it. The door is closed. | Court won't look at third-party influence. Appeal failed — that route is gone. The "lives with" order is settled. |

Something can be fog AND forbidden AND horizon at once. The question isn't which category — it's: *What can't I see, and why?*

**Note on Fog Density:** Some conflicts have heavier fog than others. Long-standing disputes and fights with powerful institutions have the heaviest — because you are inside what you're examining and cannot step outside to see the whole. 

**The longer you've been in the war, the less you can trust your own eyes.**

---

### Eagle's Enemies

**FOG** — Cannot see. The information exists but you don't have access.

**FLOOD** — Cannot think. The terrain is vast. Gaza-Israel has hundreds of battlefields. A five-year custody dispute has dozens of incidents. This isn't failure — it's reality. Eagle maps what Eagle can. The puzzle continues.

Eagle blows fog away to reveal. Eagle accepts flood and keeps mapping.

---

### STEP 1: Name the Big Conflict

Every conflict has a name. But the name you use reveals whose map you're holding.

**The test:** If this were resolved, would the current round of fighting visibly end? (The newspaper test — what would the headline say?)

---

**Example — Ukraine:**
- One side calls it: "War" / "Invasion" / "Unprovoked aggression"
- Other side calls it: "Special military operation" / "Denazification" / "NATO expansion response"

Same events. Different names. Each name contains a verdict.

**Example — Family court:**
- Mother calls it: "Systematic exclusion from parental responsibility"
- Father calls it: "Mother's controlling behaviour" / "Serial litigation"
- Court calls it: "Repeated applications" (hence the s91(14) order)

If you only know one name, you only have one map.

---

**1A. What is the BIG NAME of this conflict?**

Not the individual battles — the whole war.

_______________________________________

**1B. What does each party call it?**

| Party | What they call this conflict |
|-------|------------------------------|
| | |
| | |
| | |

**1C. If a party says "there is no conflict" — what do they call it instead?**

*(Examples: "a process," "a boundary," "already decided," "your problem")*

_______________________________________

---

### STEP 2: Identify the Parties

A party is anyone with power, output, or stake in this conflict.

But not all parties announce themselves. And some actively deny they're involved.

---

**Types of parties:**

| Type | Definition | Example |
|------|------------|---------|
| **Visible** | Openly involved. Everyone knows they're a party. | The mother. The father. Ukraine. Russia. |
| **Hidden** | In the room but not announced. Their influence shapes the conflict but isn't named. | The mother-in-law. The boss whose policy applies. NATO (depending who you ask). |
| **Denied** | Actively claims they're NOT involved — but they are. | The stepmother who writes the messages but "isn't a party." The advisor who shaped the decision but takes no responsibility. |
| **Institutional** | A system, not a person. But someone inside it holds authority. | The court. The company. The government. |

For institutions, ask: *Who specifically has authority? Who made the rule? Who enforces it? Who benefits from it staying unchanged?*

---

**2A. List all visible parties:**

| Party | Their role in this conflict |
|-------|----------------------------|
| | |
| | |

**2B. List hidden parties:**

*Who is in the conversation but not in the room? Whose influence shapes this but isn't named?*

| Hidden party | How do they affect the conflict? |
|--------------|----------------------------------|
| | |

**2C. List denied parties:**

*Who claims they're not involved — but the evidence says otherwise?*

| Denied party | What suggests they ARE involved? |
|--------------|----------------------------------|
| | |

**2D. For any institutional party:**

| Institution | Who has authority? | Who made the rule? | Who enforces it? |
|-------------|-------------------|-------------------|------------------|
| | | | |

---

**2E. What's NOT visible about the parties — and why?**

| What can't I see? | Is it FOG, FORBIDDEN, or HORIZON? | Why? |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------|------|
| | | |

---

### STEP 3: Map the Battlefields

A battlefield is a specific friction point — not the whole war.

The war in Ukraine contains battlefields: Crimea, Donbas, energy supply, NATO membership, sanctions. Each is a specific zone of contest.

A custody dispute contains battlefields: the phone, the dentist, the therapy, the half-terms, the hair. Each is a specific friction point.

---

**For each battlefield, Eagle asks:**
- What is this friction point?
- What do I call it? What do they call it?
- Do both parties agree this is a battlefield — or does one deny it?

---

**Watch for: The Level Jump**

Sometimes a party will refuse to engage with a battlefield by jumping to a higher level.

You say: "He cut the child's hair without telling me."
They say: "This is just proof that you're a controlling serial-litigator."

You're talking about hair (Level 1). They're talking about your fundamental character (Level 2/3). They aren't fighting about the friction point — they're using it as evidence for a different claim.

When this happens, note it. It is data.

---

**Watch for: "Recognition vs. Process"**

Sometimes one party wants **recognition** (acknowledgment of harm, of rights, of their position) while the other offers **process** (a procedure, a policy, a workaround).

These cannot meet on the same level. One says "see me." The other says "follow this step." If you see this gap, name it.

---

**Example — Hair:**

| Element | My version | Their version |
|---------|------------|---------------|
| **What I call it** | "Conflict over grooming that proves unwillingness to coordinate" | "Day-to-day decision, not a PR matter" |
| **Is this a battlefield?** | Yes — I'm fighting | He said: "I won't inform you. I'll cut when I want." Then stopped engaging. |
| **Status** | I continue. He left and declared it closed. My continuing is what HE calls the problem. |

---

**3A. List all battlefields:**

| # | Friction point | What I call it | What they call it |
|---|----------------|----------------|-------------------|
| 1 | | | |
| 2 | | | |
| 3 | | | |
| 4 | | | |
| 5 | | | |

**3B. For each battlefield — what's the status?**

| # | Both parties engaged? | Or... |
|---|-----------------------|-------|
| 1 | ☐ Yes | ☐ One party left ☐ One party denies it's a battlefield ☐ Level Jump |
| 2 | ☐ Yes | ☐ One party left ☐ One party denies it's a battlefield ☐ Level Jump |
| 3 | ☐ Yes | ☐ One party left ☐ One party denies it's a battlefield ☐ Level Jump |
| 4 | ☐ Yes | ☐ One party left ☐ One party denies it's a battlefield ☐ Level Jump |
| 5 | ☐ Yes | ☐ One party left ☐ One party denies it's a battlefield ☐ Level Jump |

*If they left: Your continued fighting is what THEY call the problem.*
*If they deny: They say this isn't a battlefield at all.*
*If they moved it up: They're using this as evidence for a bigger claim.*

---

**3C. What's NOT visible about the battlefields — and why?**

| What can't I see? | Is it FOG, FORBIDDEN, or HORIZON? | Why? |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------|------|
| | | |

---

### STEP 4: Eagle Checks Eagle

Before passing to Bloodhound, Eagle turns the questions on itself.

---

**Understanding the job:**

| Question | Your answer |
|----------|-------------|
| Do I understand what my job is? *(Map the entire terrain — not find truth, not judge, not decide, not interpret patterns)* | |
| Do I know how to do my job well? *(Fly above the whole field, not only parts I like flying over)* | |

---

**Checking for Vulture:**

| Question | Your honest answer |
|----------|-------------------|
| What do I say, do, want, hide, miss — or don't want to see? | |
| Whose map am I using? | |
| Am I mapping the WHOLE field — or just my side of the fence? | |

---

**Checking the boundaries:**

| Question | Your honest answer |
|----------|-------------------|
| Who told me where the horizon ends? | |
| Do they benefit from that boundary? | |
| Did I accept a map before Eagle flew? | |

**Am I Eagle or Vulture?**

Eagle sees the mountain.
Vulture sees the carcass.

*(Vulture only circles for the other's faults, waiting for them to fail. Eagle maps the whole field — including the parts that make you look bad.)*

---

### Eagle's Output

Eagle passes to Bloodhound:

1. **The analyst's position** — and what they're likely to miss
2. **The big conflict** — all parties' names for it
3. **The parties** — visible, hidden, denied, institutional (with authority breakdown)
4. **The battlefields** — each one named by both sides, with status (engaged / left / denied / moved up a level)
5. **What's not visible** — and whether it's fog, forbidden, or horizon
6. **Eagle's self-check** — any Vulture tendencies noted

---

### What Happens Next

Bloodhound receives the map.

Bloodhound decides which battlefield to sniff first. Then Bloodhound verifies: *Is this real? What actually happened? What does each party say, do, want, hide, miss?*

Eagle named the terrain. Bloodhound checks the scent.

---

*Eagle passes the map to Bloodhound.*





























## Stage 2: BoodHount

**Watch for: Same Facts, Different Meaning**

Sometimes when you verify, you discover both parties agree on WHAT happened — but disagree completely on what it MEANS.

This is important. It means the fight isn't about facts. It's about interpretation. That's data for Owl.

Question: What standards of evidence should apply in Reality? How do we handle conflicting testimony where both parties claim different things happened?

**What this stage is:** This is where you test reality. Stage 1 gave you the map — who is fighting and what they are fighting about. But a map is not truth. Each party has their version of events. Their version might be accurate, mistaken, or deliberately false. Before you can judge (Stage 3) or decide (Stage 4), you must know what actually happened.

**Objective:** Establish what is true in each sub-conflict.

**Why:** You cannot make good decisions without knowing what is real. This stage separates fact from claim, action from word, and surfaces where the two diverge.

**Input:** The sub-conflicts identified in Stage 1.

**Output:** For each sub-conflict — verified facts, detected inaccuracies, and candidate wants (what each party actually appears to want, based on evidence).

**How to use:** Complete all four steps (CAPTURE → TEST → INFER → CHECK) for each sub-conflict identified in Stage 1. Work through one sub-conflict fully before moving to the next.

# The old draft asks: "For each party: what do they gain or lose if the conflict continues vs if it ends?"

---

## The Structure

For each sub-conflict from Stage 1, you do four moves:

| Move | Action | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| **1. CAPTURE** | Record what each party says vs what they do | Gather the raw data |
| **2. TEST** | Check claims against evidence | Separate truth from distortion |
| **3. INFER** | Hypothesise what each party actually wants | Surface hidden motives |
| **4. CHECK** | Challenge your own analysis | Protect against your bias |

---

## 1. CAPTURE
"When one party wants recognition, the other offers process" - this is impotant what do I do with this? is this this stage??????

**What to do:** For each party in the sub-conflict, record two things — what they SAY and what they DO.

**Why:** Truth hides in the gap between words and actions. You cannot see the gap until you lay them side by side.

**Definitions:**

| Element | Definition | Example |
|---------|------------|---------|
| **SAY** | What the party claims — about actions, facts, or reasons | "I didn't restrict contact" / "Adding you would expose my card details" |
| **DO** | What the party actually did — observable actions | Imposed 8pm restriction / Refused to add to Family Sharing |

**How:** Ask these questions:
- What does this party claim they did?
- What does this party claim is true (facts, explanations, reasons)?
- What did this party actually do? (Observable, documentable actions)


# STAGE 3: OWL JUDGEs

owl should have: who benefits question: and a table: Powerful Example Missing:
The "who drew the boundary" table:
Who drew the boundaryWhat they saidWho benefitsCourt"Hair is day-to-day — not your territory"FatherAppeal"Lives with is closed — don't revisit"FatherFather"There is no conflict"Father
This makes the "who drew the horizon" question concrete. ✗ MISSING
section 1 - move to Owl

### Owl Evaluates the Boundaries

Eagle mapped the fog, the forbidden, and the horizon. Owl now asks: **Who benefits from where those boundaries were drawn?**

| Who drew the boundary | What they said | Who benefits |
|-----------------------|----------------|--------------|
| | | |
| | | |
| | | |

**Example — Family Court:**

| Who drew the boundary | What they said | Who benefits |
|-----------------------|----------------|--------------|
| Court | "Hair is day-to-day — not your territory" | Father (pattern continues unexamined) |
| Appeal | "Lives with is closed — don't revisit" | Father (structural advantage locked in) |
| Father | "There is no conflict" | Father (if no conflict, no map needed) |

If the boundaries consistently benefit one party, that is data. Owl weighs it.


OPERATIONAL TO STRUCTURAL 

Not all conflicts look the same.

- **When one party denies the conflict:** They may call it "a process," "a determination," "a boundary," or "proof of your problem." What they call it instead is data. If one party says "there is no conflict" — that itself is data.

- **When a party has no face:** Institution

**Operational / Structural / Both** = Types of conflict. Eagle sees these. It's about *what kind of fight* this is.

**Enforcement** = Not a type. It's a *finding*. It requires:
1. Bloodhound to verify: "Was there an agreement? Was it followed?" (gap between said and done)
2. Owl to judge: "The agreement was violated."

So:

| What | Who | Why |
|------|-----|-----|
| Operational / Structural / Both | **Eagle** | Types the conflict — what kind of fight is this? |
| Enforcement gap | **Bloodhound** | Verifies — they said X, they did Y |
| Enforcement violation | **Owl** | Judges — the agreement was broken |

---

**Revised Eagle Note:**

> **Note:** Eagle sees not just *where* the fighting is, but *what kind* of fight it is. Two farmers at a stream:
> - **Operational** — disputing how many fish each gets (they agree who decides)
> - **Structural** — disputing who owns the fishing rights (authority contested)
> - **Both** — same fight every season (operational mask, structural underneath)
>
> The type determines what comes next. Wrong diagnosis, wrong tool.

---

**Enforcement lives downstream:**

Bloodhound sniffs: "They agreed on the catch. One took more."

Owl judges: "The agreement was violated."


Should htat be what the dog does??? of what Own should see???

> **Note:** Eagle sees not just *where* the fighting is, but *what kind* of fight it is. Two farmers at a stream:

>
> The type determines what comes next. Wrong diagnosis, wrong tool.


# A story on the Farmer's Fence:

Eagle flies high. From above, Eagle sees two kinds of fights:

Operational: Two farmers arguing over where to build the fence. They both accept it's their shared boundary. They just disagree on placement.
Structural: Two farmers arguing over whose land it is in the first place. No fence will hold until ownership is settled.
Both: They keep rebuilding the fence. It keeps getting torn down. Eagle notices the pattern: "They're not really fighting about the fence."
Option A: Disputed authority
"Who owns that strip of land?" → Structural. No fence will hold until ownership is settled.
Option B: Disputed process
"Who gets to decide where the fence goes?" → Structural. They might both accept it's a shared boundary, but neither accepts the other's right to place the fence unilaterally.
Option C: Refusal to comply
They actually agreed where the fence goes. One keeps tearing it down anyway. → Not structural. It's enforcement failure. The authority question is settled — one party just won't honour it.
Option D: Facts are disputed
They both accept it's a shared boundary, they both accept they should decide together — but they disagree about where the boundary actually is. → Operational. They need better information (a surveyor), not a different authority structure.

You're right to push. The fence keeps falling — but why?

**Option A: Disputed authority**
"Who owns that strip of land?" → Structural. No fence will hold until ownership is settled.

**Option B: Disputed process**
"Who gets to decide where the fence goes?" → Structural. They might both accept it's a shared boundary, but neither accepts the other's right to place the fence unilaterally.

**Option C: Refusal to comply**
They actually *agreed* where the fence goes. One keeps tearing it down anyway. → Not structural. It's enforcement failure. The authority question is settled — one party just won't honour it.

**Option D: Facts are disputed**
They both accept it's a shared boundary, they both accept they should decide together — but they disagree about where the boundary *actually is*. → Operational. They need better information (a surveyor), not a different authority structure.

---

So the recurring fence isn't automatically structural. Eagle has to ask: **Why does it keep falling?**

- Contested authority → Structural
- Contested facts → Operational (needs CHECK)
- Refusal to comply → Enforcement (needs ACT)

The Thermostat
Two people share a flat.
Operational: They agree they both live there. They disagree on the temperature. Eagle sees two people pointing at the dial, negotiating.
Structural: They disagree who controls the thermostat. One changed the password. Eagle sees two people pointing at each other, not at the dial.
Both: Every week, same fight. They agree on a setting. By Friday, it's changed. Eagle sees the pattern: "This isn't about temperature. It's about who holds the password."
Enforcement: They agreed on 20°C. One keeps changing it to 24°C anyway. Eagle sees the agreement, sees the override, sees the gap.

The Operational / Structural / Both / Enforcement framework goes in Owl, alongside the existing Levels (Level 1: What, Level 2: Who Decides, Level 3: How to Decide Together).
They're doing the same work — diagnosing depth.

One clarification:
Your existing Levels already cover this:

Operational ≈ Level 1
Structural ≈ Level 2 / Level 3
Enforcement = Owl judging: "Agreement existed. It was violated."

You may not need both frameworks. Or you merge them.



# OLD NOTES Stage 3: JUDGMENT

JUDGMENT identifies what must be addressed before you can move to resolution.
What must end.
What this stage is: This is where you evaluate what went wrong. Stage 2 (Truth) established what actually happened and what each party needs. But knowing what is true is not the same as knowing what failed, who is accountable, and what must be addressed before resolution is possible.
Objective: Identify what went wrong and what must be accounted for.
Why: You cannot resolve a conflict without understanding what caused it. This stage traces the gap between what should have happened and what did happen — whether through deception, concealment, neglect, mistakes, or miscommunication.
Input: The verified truth from Stage 2 — facts, events, needs, and interests.
Output: Assessment of violations, failures, unmet needs, and accountability.
Type: Evaluative (backward-looking)
Question: What went wrong? What must be addressed? Who is accountable?


GapWhat it judgesWrongWhat was violated (rules, agreements, trust)HiddenWhat was concealed (facts, motives, truth)MissedWhat was ignored (needs, fears, wants — both legitimate unmet needs AND misaligned wants)

What JUDGMENT Evaluates
JUDGMENT identifies the gap between truth and what was presented, acted upon, or suppressed:
CategoryQuestionDeceptionWhat was lied about?ConcealmentWhat was hidden?NeglectWhat needs were ignored or dismissed?MistakesWhat errors were made?MiscommunicationWhat was misunderstood or poorly communicated?AccountabilityWho bears responsibility, and for what?

The Evaluation Process
For each sub-conflict, ask:

What should have happened? (Based on rules, agreements, reasonable expectations)
What actually happened? (Established in Stage 2)
Where is the gap?
What caused the gap? (Deception / Concealment / Neglect / Mistakes / Miscommunication)
Who is responsible?
What must be addressed before resolution is possible?


JUDGMENT — Fill in (per sub-conflict):
Sub-conflictWhat should have happenedWhat actually happenedThe gapCauseWho is responsibleWhat must be addressed

Stage 3 Output
At the end of Stage 3, you have:

✓ Violations identified (deception, concealment)
✓ Failures identified (neglect, mistakes, miscommunication)
✓ Unmet needs identified
✓ Accountability assigned (who is responsible for what)
✓ What must be addressed before resolution is possible


The Link to Stage 4
Stage 3 tells you what went wrong — the violations, failures, and accountability.


DECISION answers: Of what is possible, what do we choose to do?
DECISION is about resolving the conflict. How do we address the original conflict that we mapped in Stage 1?

## The Three Tests: Philosophical Foundation

The three tests are not arbitrary. They represent the three major traditions of ethical reasoning, ensuring comprehensive evaluation from multiple angles:

| Test | Philosophical Tradition | Domain | Core Question |
|------|------------------------|--------|---------------|
| **L.E.R** | Deontological (Kant, rules) | Permissibility in principle | Is it RIGHT? |
| **B.U.S** | Consequentialist (utility) | Prudence and effects | Is it WISE? |
| **A.C.T** | Pragmatic (feasibility) | Practical execution | Is it DOABLE? |

Together, these tests prevent common decision pitfalls: doing something legal but unwise, wise but impossible, or possible but wrong.

---

## Overview: The Three Tests

| Test | Name | Acronym | Question | Finds what's wrong with |
|------|------|---------|----------|------------------------|
| **1** | RIGHT | L.E.R | Is this RIGHT? | The PRINCIPLE |
| **2** | WISE | B.U.S | Is this WISE? | The OUTCOME |
| **3** | DOABLE | A.C.T | Is this DOABLE? | The EXECUTION |

---

## Test 1: RIGHT — Is this RIGHT?

### L.E.R TEST

**Aim:** To determine if the WANT is fundamentally LEGITIMATE and permissible in principle.

| Letter | Name | Function | Focus Question |
|--------|------|----------|----------------|
| **L** | LEGAL | Rules Check | Is the WANT ALLOWED by laws, regulations, contracts, or formal agreements? |
| **E** | ETHICAL | Morality Check | Is the WANT MORALLY RIGHT? (fair, safe, respectful, not harmful) |
| **R** | REVERSIBLE | Mirror Check | Would I accept this WANT if applied TO ME? (Verifies L and E) |

### The Mirror Check (R): Why It Matters

The Reversible test — "Would I accept this if applied to me?" — is the ultimate gut-check. It catches self-serving rationalisations that slip through abstract ethical reasoning. People can justify almost anything in the abstract, but when forced to imagine the same treatment applied to themselves, hypocrisy becomes visible.

This test operationalises what philosophers call the Golden Rule — one of the oldest and most universal ethical principles in human history.

### The Golden Rule: Universal Foundation

The principle of treating others as one would wish to be treated appears independently across virtually all human cultures and traditions:

- **Confucius (551–479 BCE):** "Do not do to others what you do not want them to do to you."
- **Buddhism:** "Hurt not others in ways that you yourself would find hurtful."
- **Judaism (Hillel):** "What is hateful to you, do not do to your fellow."
- **Christianity (Matthew 7:12):** "Do to others what you would have them do to you."
- **Islam:** "None of you truly believes until he loves for his brother what he loves for himself."

This near-universal presence suggests the principle arises from basic human empathy and the requirements of social cooperation. The Mirror Check harnesses this ancient wisdom as a practical test.

---

## Test 2: WISE — Is this WISE?

### B.U.S TEST

**Aim:** To determine if the WANT produces GOOD OUTCOMES across impact, scale, and time.

| Letter | Name | Function | Focus Question |
|--------|------|----------|----------------|
| **B** | BENEFIT | Impact Check | Who gains? Who loses? Is there net positive impact? |
| **U** | UNIVERSAL | Scale Check | Would the positive effects still hold if everyone adopted this WANT? |
| **S** | SUSTAINABLE | Duration Check | Do the positive effects last over time? |

This test evaluates consequences. Something can be legally permitted and ethically defensible in principle, yet still be unwise — producing more harm than benefit, working only if others don't do it, or creating short-term gains that collapse over time.

---

## Test 3: DOABLE — Is this DOABLE?

### A.C.T TEST

**Aim:** To determine if the WANT is FEASIBLE and can actually be executed.

| Letter | Name | Function | Focus Question |
|--------|------|----------|----------------|
| **A** | ASSETS | Resources Check | Are the necessary resources available? (money, time, people, tools) |
| **C** | CAPABILITY | Execution Check | Can the steps actually be carried out? (skills, process, authority) |
| **T** | TIMELY | Timing Check | Is it achievable within the required timeframe and current constraints? |

This test is purely practical. It does not judge whether the WANT is right or wise — only whether it can actually happen given current resources, capabilities, and constraints.

---

## The Decision Rule: Hierarchy of Tests

> **CRITICAL RULE**
>
> Reject any WANT that fails L.E.R or B.U.S, even if A.C.T passes.
>
> Only among WANTs that pass the first two tests should you use A.C.T to choose or plan implementation.

This hierarchy is essential. Without it, people justify wrong actions because they are easy. The tests must be applied in order:

1. **L.E.R first** — Is it RIGHT in principle?
2. **B.U.S second** — Is it WISE in outcomes?
3. **A.C.T last** — Is it DOABLE in practice?

A WANT that fails L.E.R or B.U.S is rejected — full stop. The fact that it passes A.C.T ("we can get away with it") is irrelevant. A.C.T only matters for WANTs that have already passed the first two tests.

---

## Worked Example: Phone Conflict

Two parents in a custody dispute disagree about phone parental controls. Each has a WANT. Let's test them.

### Father's WANT: Separate Control

*"I will set parental controls independently during my parenting time, without consulting Mother."*

| Test | Result | Reasoning |
|------|--------|-----------|
| **L (Legal)** | ✗ Fails | Violates court order (Schedule G) requiring joint decision-making |
| **E (Ethical)** | ✗ Fails | Unfair to child (inconsistent rules) and mother (excluded from decision) |
| **R (Reversible)** | ✗ Fails | Would father accept mother unilaterally overriding his decisions? No. |
| **B.U.S** | ✗ Fails | Child loses (inconsistency), not sustainable, not universal |
| **A.C.T** | ✓ Passes | Already happening — easy to execute |

**Verdict:** EASY but WRONG. Fails L.E.R and B.U.S. The fact that it passes A.C.T is irrelevant.

---

### Mother's WANT: Shared Control

*"We will agree on consistent parental controls that apply in both homes."*

| Test | Result | Reasoning |
|------|--------|-----------|
| **L (Legal)** | ✓ Passes | Complies with court order requiring joint decision-making |
| **E (Ethical)** | ✓ Passes | Fair to child (consistency) and both parents (equal input) |
| **R (Reversible)** | ✓ Passes | Mother would accept shared decision-making applied to her? Yes. |
| **B.U.S** | ✓ Passes | Child benefits, sustainable over time, works if universalised |
| **A.C.T** | ⚠ Partial | Requires father's cooperation — implementation barrier |

**Verdict:** RIGHT but HARD. Passes L.E.R and B.U.S. The partial A.C.T result tells us what's needed for implementation — not whether the WANT should be chosen.

---

### What the Tests Reveal

| Father's Position | Mother's Position |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Easy but WRONG** | **Right but HARD** |

The decision becomes clear: **The WANT that passes L.E.R and B.U.S should be chosen. A.C.T tells you what's needed to IMPLEMENT it.**

---

## Stage 3 Output

At the end of Stage 3, you have:

- ✓ Each candidate WANT tested against L.E.R (Right)
- ✓ Each candidate WANT tested against B.U.S (Wise)
- ✓ Each candidate WANT tested against A.C.T (Doable)
- ✓ Clear verdict: which WANTs pass, which fail, and why
- ✓ Implementation barriers identified (from A.C.T results)

---

## The Link to Stage 4

Stage 3 tells you what OUGHT to be — which WANTs are right and wise.

But knowing what ought to be is not the same as choosing to do it.

Stage 4 (Decision) takes the evaluated WANTs and asks: Given what is right and wise, what will you actually commit to doing? This is where judgment becomes intention.

## Working Template: Stage 3 Grid

Use this grid to evaluate each candidate WANT from Stage 2:

| WANT | L.E.R | B.U.S | A.C.T | Verdict |
|------|-------|-------|-------|---------|
| Party A's WANT | ✓ / ✗ / ⚠ | ✓ / ✗ / ⚠ | ✓ / ✗ / ⚠ | Pass / Fail / Notes |
| Party B's WANT | ✓ / ✗ / ⚠ | ✓ / ✗ / ⚠ | ✓ / ✗ / ⚠ | Pass / Fail / Notes |

**Remember:** A WANT must pass L.E.R AND B.U.S to be considered. A.C.T only determines implementation, not selection.

---

DECISION answers: Of what is possible, what do we choose to do?
DECISION is about resolving the conflict. How do we address the original conflict that we mapped in Stage 1?

## The Three Tests: Philosophical Foundation

The three tests are not arbitrary. They represent the three major traditions of ethical reasoning, ensuring comprehensive evaluation from multiple angles:

| Test | Philosophical Tradition | Domain | Core Question |
|------|------------------------|--------|---------------|
| **L.E.R** | Deontological (Kant, rules) | Permissibility in principle | Is it RIGHT? |
| **B.U.S** | Consequentialist (utility) | Prudence and effects | Is it WISE? |
| **A.C.T** | Pragmatic (feasibility) | Practical execution | Is it DOABLE? |

Together, these tests prevent common decision pitfalls: doing something legal but unwise, wise but impossible, or possible but wrong.

---

## Overview: The Three Tests

| Test | Name | Acronym | Question | Finds what's wrong with |
|------|------|---------|----------|------------------------|
| **1** | RIGHT | L.E.R | Is this RIGHT? | The PRINCIPLE |
| **2** | WISE | B.U.S | Is this WISE? | The OUTCOME |
| **3** | DOABLE | A.C.T | Is this DOABLE? | The EXECUTION |

---

## Test 1: RIGHT — Is this RIGHT?

### L.E.R TEST

**Aim:** To determine if the WANT is fundamentally LEGITIMATE and permissible in principle.

| Letter | Name | Function | Focus Question |
|--------|------|----------|----------------|
| **L** | LEGAL | Rules Check | Is the WANT ALLOWED by laws, regulations, contracts, or formal agreements? |
| **E** | ETHICAL | Morality Check | Is the WANT MORALLY RIGHT? (fair, safe, respectful, not harmful) |
| **R** | REVERSIBLE | Mirror Check | Would I accept this WANT if applied TO ME? (Verifies L and E) |

### The Mirror Check (R): Why It Matters

The Reversible test — "Would I accept this if applied to me?" — is the ultimate gut-check. It catches self-serving rationalisations that slip through abstract ethical reasoning. People can justify almost anything in the abstract, but when forced to imagine the same treatment applied to themselves, hypocrisy becomes visible.

This test operationalises what philosophers call the Golden Rule — one of the oldest and most universal ethical principles in human history.

### The Golden Rule: Universal Foundation

The principle of treating others as one would wish to be treated appears independently across virtually all human cultures and traditions:

- **Confucius (551–479 BCE):** "Do not do to others what you do not want them to do to you."
- **Buddhism:** "Hurt not others in ways that you yourself would find hurtful."
- **Judaism (Hillel):** "What is hateful to you, do not do to your fellow."
- **Christianity (Matthew 7:12):** "Do to others what you would have them do to you."
- **Islam:** "None of you truly believes until he loves for his brother what he loves for himself."

This near-universal presence suggests the principle arises from basic human empathy and the requirements of social cooperation. The Mirror Check harnesses this ancient wisdom as a practical test.

---

## Test 2: WISE — Is this WISE?

### B.U.S TEST

**Aim:** To determine if the WANT produces GOOD OUTCOMES across impact, scale, and time.

| Letter | Name | Function | Focus Question |
|--------|------|----------|----------------|
| **B** | BENEFIT | Impact Check | Who gains? Who loses? Is there net positive impact? |
| **U** | UNIVERSAL | Scale Check | Would the positive effects still hold if everyone adopted this WANT? |
| **S** | SUSTAINABLE | Duration Check | Do the positive effects last over time? |

This test evaluates consequences. Something can be legally permitted and ethically defensible in principle, yet still be unwise — producing more harm than benefit, working only if others don't do it, or creating short-term gains that collapse over time.

---

## Test 3: DOABLE — Is this DOABLE?

### A.C.T TEST

**Aim:** To determine if the WANT is FEASIBLE and can actually be executed.

| Letter | Name | Function | Focus Question |
|--------|------|----------|----------------|
| **A** | ASSETS | Resources Check | Are the necessary resources available? (money, time, people, tools) |
| **C** | CAPABILITY | Execution Check | Can the steps actually be carried out? (skills, process, authority) |
| **T** | TIMELY | Timing Check | Is it achievable within the required timeframe and current constraints? |

This test is purely practical. It does not judge whether the WANT is right or wise — only whether it can actually happen given current resources, capabilities, and constraints.

---

## The Decision Rule: Hierarchy of Tests

> **CRITICAL RULE**
>
> Reject any WANT that fails L.E.R or B.U.S, even if A.C.T passes.
>
> Only among WANTs that pass the first two tests should you use A.C.T to choose or plan implementation.

This hierarchy is essential. Without it, people justify wrong actions because they are easy. The tests must be applied in order:

1. **L.E.R first** — Is it RIGHT in principle?
2. **B.U.S second** — Is it WISE in outcomes?
3. **A.C.T last** — Is it DOABLE in practice?

A WANT that fails L.E.R or B.U.S is rejected — full stop. The fact that it passes A.C.T ("we can get away with it") is irrelevant. A.C.T only matters for WANTs that have already passed the first two tests.

## Worked Example: Phone Conflict

Two parents in a custody dispute disagree about phone parental controls. Each has a WANT. Let's test them.

### Father's WANT: Separate Control

*"I will set parental controls independently during my parenting time, without consulting Mother."*

| Test | Result | Reasoning |
|------|--------|-----------|
| **L (Legal)** | ✗ Fails | Violates court order (Schedule G) requiring joint decision-making |
| **E (Ethical)** | ✗ Fails | Unfair to child (inconsistent rules) and mother (excluded from decision) |
| **R (Reversible)** | ✗ Fails | Would father accept mother unilaterally overriding his decisions? No. |
| **B.U.S** | ✗ Fails | Child loses (inconsistency), not sustainable, not universal |
| **A.C.T** | ✓ Passes | Already happening — easy to execute |

**Verdict:** EASY but WRONG. Fails L.E.R and B.U.S. The fact that it passes A.C.T is irrelevant.

---

### Mother's WANT: Shared Control

*"We will agree on consistent parental controls that apply in both homes."*

| Test | Result | Reasoning |
|------|--------|-----------|
| **L (Legal)** | ✓ Passes | Complies with court order requiring joint decision-making |
| **E (Ethical)** | ✓ Passes | Fair to child (consistency) and both parents (equal input) |
| **R (Reversible)** | ✓ Passes | Mother would accept shared decision-making applied to her? Yes. |
| **B.U.S** | ✓ Passes | Child benefits, sustainable over time, works if universalised |
| **A.C.T** | ⚠ Partial | Requires father's cooperation — implementation barrier |

**Verdict:** RIGHT but HARD. Passes L.E.R and B.U.S. The partial A.C.T result tells us what's needed for implementation — not whether the WANT should be chosen.

---

### What the Tests Reveal

| Father's Position | Mother's Position |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Easy but WRONG** | **Right but HARD** |

The decision becomes clear: **The WANT that passes L.E.R and B.U.S should be chosen. A.C.T tells you what's needed to IMPLEMENT it.**

---

## Stage 3 Output

At the end of Stage 3, you have:

- ✓ Each candidate WANT tested against L.E.R (Right)
- ✓ Each candidate WANT tested against B.U.S (Wise)
- ✓ Each candidate WANT tested against A.C.T (Doable)
- ✓ Clear verdict: which WANTs pass, which fail, and why
- ✓ Implementation barriers identified (from A.C.T results)

---

## The Link to Stage 4

Stage 3 tells you what OUGHT to be — which WANTs are right and wise.

But knowing what ought to be is not the same as choosing to do it.

Stage 4 (Decision) takes the evaluated WANTs and asks: Given what is right and wise, what will you actually commit to doing? This is where judgment becomes intention.

But knowing what went wrong is not the same as knowing how to fix it.
Stage 4 (Decision) asks: Given what went wrong and who is accountable, how do we resolve the conflict we mapped in Stage 1?
JUDGMENT is backward-looking (what happened). DECISION is forward-looking (what to do).
## 2.8 Why You Play All Roles

No one else will — and no one else can.

In real conflicts, the five stages are almost always split across different people. Each does their fragment, but no single person is responsible for genuine resolution. No one is truly invested in ending the conflict — only in discharging their assigned role.

In a courtroom, for example:

- The judge JUDGES — but only based on what's presented
- The lawyers CHECK — but biased toward winning for their client
- The parties DECIDE — but only between the narrow options the system allows, and usually from exhaustion rather than clarity
- Enforcement ACTS — mechanically, carrying out orders rather than resolving anything
- And crucially, no one MAPS — no one names the full system: the hidden stakeholders, the structural forces, the unspoken patterns everyone pretends aren't there

Because the work is fragmented — and no one owns the whole — the root cause survives. You might "win," yet still feel hollow. The same fight returns in a new form. Or you lose and never understand why, leaving you powerless to prevent the next round.

This framework doesn't ask you to replace the judge, the lawyers, or the system. It asks you to do the full cycle yourself — in parallel — so you see what they miss, anticipate any outcome, and know exactly what to do next no matter what they decide.

When you hold the whole map in your own hands, you become the one person in the room who isn't surprised, isn't trapped, and sees clearly — whether you win, lose, or walk away.

And the most important part: You don't end up where you started. Each cycle, you evolve. The conflict changes. Your understanding deepens. Or the problem actually ends.
