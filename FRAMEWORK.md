## Before You Take the First Step: Locate Yourself

*Before you map the conflict, you map your position relative to it.*

---

### Why This Matters

Your position determines what you see — and what you literally cannot see.

**The Mother:** Sees threats to her children. Blind spot: her own reactivity.

**The Judge:** Sees two competing legal claims. Blind spot: her own internal biases.

**The Child:** Sees two people they love who cannot be in the same room. Blind spot: the legal machine shaping their life.

Same conflict. Three positions. Three blind spots. Three different maps.

---

### 0A. What Is My Position?

| Position | Definition |
|----------|------------|
| **Observer** | No power, no output, no stake. Purely private learning. *(Extremely rare.)* |
| **Party — Direct** | You are IN the conflict: disputant, victim, aggressor, decision-maker, the child, the court. |
| **Party — Indirect** | You are CONNECTED to the conflict but not inside it: advisor, witness, commentator, affected bystander. |

**The Reality Check:** If you are reading this to "win" or "to be right," you are a Party.

**Your role shapes your blind spot:**

| If you are... | You likely see... | Your blind spot... |
|---------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| A disputant (mother, father) | Threats to yourself or your children | Your own reactivity, your own contribution |
| A decision-maker (judge, court) | Two competing claims | Your own internal biases |
| The affected (child, grandparent) | Two people who can't be in a room | The legal/structural machine shaping your life |

**My position:** _______________________________________

**My role within that position:** _______________________________________
---

### 0B. What Am I Protecting?

What you protect is what you will refuse to map.

Are you protecting:
- Your reputation?
- Your job or career?
- Your "Good Parent" badge?
- A secret shame?
- Something you did that harmed someone?

**If you don't name what you're protecting, the Eagle will fly with one eye closed.**

**What do I protect?**

_______________________________________

**What am I most likely to miss from this position?**

_______________________________________

---

### 0C. When Are You Looking At This Conflict?

You are always looking FROM now. But the conflict itself may be in a different time.

| Time | Definition | Why It Matters |
|------|------------|----------------|
| **Past** | Already happened. You know how it ended. | Sense-making, release, justice, or prevention. |
| **Present** | Happening now. | You can see, judge, decide, and act. |
| **Future** | Has not played out yet. | Your map is hypothesis. Simulation, not resolution. |

**The conflict I am mapping is:** ☐ Past  ☐ Present  ☐ Future

---

### Note: Position Can Shift

You locate yourself once at the start. But the act of mapping can change your position.

The moment you use this framework to gain sight, you are no longer passive — you have become an Agent. If your position shifts during the process, note it.

**The map changes when the mapper changes.**

---

### Note: The Map Reflects the Map-Maker

Different parties will draw different maps of the same conflict. This is not a bug — it's data.

Your map is YOUR map. It reflects what you can see from where you stand. Later stages will test it against what others see.

---

*Now Eagle can fly.*


---

### Check Yourself

You just read "Locate Yourself." Your current state is:

- a) "Oh shit. I'm a Party. I have something to lose."
- b) "I'm definitely an Observer. This isn't about me."
- c) "I don't need to answer 'what am I protecting.' I'm not protecting anything."
- d) "This is a lot of forms. Can we just get to the part where I'm right?"

**The Verdict:** 
- If you picked (a): Good. You're ready. Eagle can fly.
- If you picked (b), (c), or (d): You're in the Fog. Go back to 0B. Name what you're protecting. Then try again.










# STAGE 1: EAGLE MAPs

<img width="1024" height="747" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c369c724-9700-4011-9ce4-92c8fad4ac9c" />

## EAGLE — MAPs

### Eagle Maps the Terrain

*Because you cannot navigate a field you haven't named.*

---

### What Eagle Does

Eagle flies at 10,000 feet. From up there, the "World-Ending War" becomes something nameable: specific parties, specific friction points, specific zones where sight is blocked.

Eagle doesn't verify — that's Bloodhound's job. Eagle doesn't judge — that's Owl. Eagle doesn't decide — that's Lion.

**Eagle's focus is not on the "True." Eagle's focus is on the "Entire."**

Eagle just sees the whole.

---

### Eagle's Sequence

1. **The Big Picture** — Name the conflict itself
2. **The Parties** — Who is involved (including those hidden or denied)
3. **The Battlefields** — The specific friction points within the big conflict

For each of these, Eagle notes what's VISIBLE and what's NOT — and WHY it's not visible.

---

### Why You Can't See Something

Not everything on the map is visible. When something is hidden, ask WHY:

| Reason | Definition | Example |
|--------|------------|---------|
| **FOG** | Information is hidden or inaccessible. You don't have it. | What happens in the other household. What they actually want. Who made the decision. |
| **FORBIDDEN** | Someone told you not to look there. A rule, a law, a social norm. | "The stepmother isn't a party." "Hair is day-to-day, not a PR matter." "We don't discuss 2014." |
| **HORIZON** | Outside the frame. The system won't examine it. The door is closed. | Court won't look at third-party influence. Appeal failed — that route is gone. The "lives with" order is settled. |

Something can be fog AND forbidden AND horizon at once. The question isn't which category — it's: *What can't I see, and why?*

**Note on Fog Density:** Some conflicts have heavier fog than others. Long-standing disputes and fights with powerful institutions have the heaviest — because you are inside what you're examining and cannot step outside to see the whole. 

**The longer you've been in the war, the less you can trust your own eyes.**

---

### Eagle's Enemies

**FOG** — Cannot see. The information exists but you don't have access.

**FLOOD** — Cannot think. The terrain is vast. Gaza-Israel has hundreds of battlefields. A five-year custody dispute has dozens of incidents. This isn't failure — it's reality. Eagle maps what Eagle can. The puzzle continues.

Eagle blows fog away to reveal. Eagle accepts flood and keeps mapping.

---

### STEP 1: Name the Big Conflict

Every conflict has a name. But the name you use reveals whose map you're holding.

**The test:** If this were resolved, would the current round of fighting visibly end? (The newspaper test — what would the headline say?)

---

**Example — Ukraine:**
- One side calls it: "War" / "Invasion" / "Unprovoked aggression"
- Other side calls it: "Special military operation" / "Denazification" / "NATO expansion response"

Same events. Different names. Each name contains a verdict.

**Example — Family court:**
- Mother calls it: "Systematic exclusion from parental responsibility"
- Father calls it: "Mother's controlling behaviour" / "Serial litigation"
- Court calls it: "Repeated applications" (hence the s91(14) order)

If you only know one name, you only have one map.

---

**1A. What is the BIG NAME of this conflict?**

Not the individual battles — the whole war.

_______________________________________

**1B. What does each party call it?**

| Party | What they call this conflict |
|-------|------------------------------|
| | |
| | |
| | |

**1C. If a party says "there is no conflict" — what do they call it instead?**

*(Examples: "a process," "a boundary," "already decided," "your problem")*

_______________________________________

---

### STEP 2: Identify the Parties

A party is anyone with power, output, or stake in this conflict.

But not all parties announce themselves. And some actively deny they're involved.

---

**Types of parties:**

| Type | Definition | Example |
|------|------------|---------|
| **Visible** | Openly involved. Everyone knows they're a party. | The mother. The father. Ukraine. Russia. |
| **Hidden** | In the room but not announced. Their influence shapes the conflict but isn't named. | The mother-in-law. The boss whose policy applies. NATO (depending who you ask). |
| **Denied** | Actively claims they're NOT involved — but they are. | The stepmother who writes the messages but "isn't a party." The advisor who shaped the decision but takes no responsibility. |
| **Institutional** | A system, not a person. But someone inside it holds authority. | The court. The company. The government. |

For institutions, ask: *Who specifically has authority? Who made the rule? Who enforces it? Who benefits from it staying unchanged?*

---

**2A. List all visible parties:**

| Party | Their role in this conflict |
|-------|----------------------------|
| | |
| | |

**2B. List hidden parties:**

*Who is in the conversation but not in the room? Whose influence shapes this but isn't named?*

| Hidden party | How do they affect the conflict? |
|--------------|----------------------------------|
| | |

**2C. List denied parties:**

*Who claims they're not involved — but the evidence says otherwise?*

| Denied party | What suggests they ARE involved? |
|--------------|----------------------------------|
| | |

**2D. For any institutional party:**

| Institution | Who has authority? | Who made the rule? | Who enforces it? |
|-------------|-------------------|-------------------|------------------|
| | | | |

---

**2E. What's NOT visible about the parties — and why?**

| What can't I see? | Is it FOG, FORBIDDEN, or HORIZON? | Why? |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------|------|
| | | |

---

### STEP 3: Map the Battlefields

A battlefield is a specific friction point — not the whole war.

The war in Ukraine contains battlefields: Crimea, Donbas, energy supply, NATO membership, sanctions. Each is a specific zone of contest.

A custody dispute contains battlefields: the phone, the dentist, the therapy, the half-terms, the hair. Each is a specific friction point.

---

**For each battlefield, Eagle asks:**
- What is this friction point?
- What do I call it? What do they call it?
- Do both parties agree this is a battlefield — or does one deny it?

---

**Watch for: The Level Jump**

Sometimes a party will refuse to engage with a battlefield by jumping to a higher level.

You say: "He cut the child's hair without telling me."
They say: "This is just proof that you're a controlling serial-litigator."

You're talking about hair (Level 1). They're talking about your fundamental character (Level 2/3). They aren't fighting about the friction point — they're using it as evidence for a different claim.

When this happens, note it. It is data.

---

**Watch for: "Recognition vs. Process"**

Sometimes one party wants **recognition** (acknowledgment of harm, of rights, of their position) while the other offers **process** (a procedure, a policy, a workaround).

These cannot meet on the same level. One says "see me." The other says "follow this step." If you see this gap, name it.

---

**Example — Hair:**

| Element | My version | Their version |
|---------|------------|---------------|
| **What I call it** | "Conflict over grooming that proves unwillingness to coordinate" | "Day-to-day decision, not a PR matter" |
| **Is this a battlefield?** | Yes — I'm fighting | He said: "I won't inform you. I'll cut when I want." Then stopped engaging. |
| **Status** | I continue. He left and declared it closed. My continuing is what HE calls the problem. |

---

**3A. List all battlefields:**

| # | Friction point | What I call it | What they call it |
|---|----------------|----------------|-------------------|
| 1 | | | |
| 2 | | | |
| 3 | | | |
| 4 | | | |
| 5 | | | |

**3B. For each battlefield — what's the status?**

| # | Both parties engaged? | Or... |
|---|-----------------------|-------|
| 1 | ☐ Yes | ☐ One party left ☐ One party denies it's a battlefield ☐ Level Jump |
| 2 | ☐ Yes | ☐ One party left ☐ One party denies it's a battlefield ☐ Level Jump |
| 3 | ☐ Yes | ☐ One party left ☐ One party denies it's a battlefield ☐ Level Jump |
| 4 | ☐ Yes | ☐ One party left ☐ One party denies it's a battlefield ☐ Level Jump |
| 5 | ☐ Yes | ☐ One party left ☐ One party denies it's a battlefield ☐ Level Jump |

*If they left: Your continued fighting is what THEY call the problem.*
*If they deny: They say this isn't a battlefield at all.*
*If they moved it up: They're using this as evidence for a bigger claim.*

---

**3C. What's NOT visible about the battlefields — and why?**

| What can't I see? | Is it FOG, FORBIDDEN, or HORIZON? | Why? |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------|------|
| | | |

---

### STEP 4: Eagle Checks Eagle

Before passing to Bloodhound, Eagle turns the questions on itself.

---

**Understanding the job:**

| Question | Your answer |
|----------|-------------|
| Do I understand what my job is? *(Map the entire terrain — not find truth, not judge, not decide, not interpret patterns)* | |
| Do I know how to do my job well? *(Fly above the whole field, not only parts I like flying over)* | |

---

**Checking for Vulture:**

| Question | Your honest answer |
|----------|-------------------|
| What do I say, do, want, hide, miss — or don't want to see? | |
| Whose map am I using? | |
| Am I mapping the WHOLE field — or just my side of the fence? | |

---

**Checking the boundaries:**

| Question | Your honest answer |
|----------|-------------------|
| Who told me where the horizon ends? | |
| Do they benefit from that boundary? | |
| Did I accept a map before Eagle flew? | |

**Am I Eagle or Vulture?**

Eagle sees the mountain.
Vulture sees the carcass.

*(Vulture only circles for the other's faults, waiting for them to fail. Eagle maps the whole field — including the parts that make you look bad.)*

---

### Eagle's Output

Eagle passes to Bloodhound:

1. **The analyst's position** — and what they're likely to miss
2. **The big conflict** — all parties' names for it
3. **The parties** — visible, hidden, denied, institutional (with authority breakdown)
4. **The battlefields** — each one named by both sides, with status (engaged / left / denied / moved up a level)
5. **What's not visible** — and whether it's fog, forbidden, or horizon
6. **Eagle's self-check** — any Vulture tendencies noted

---

### What Happens Next

Bloodhound receives the map.

Bloodhound decides which battlefield to sniff first. Then Bloodhound verifies: *Is this real? What actually happened? What does each party say, do, want, hide, miss?*

Eagle named the terrain. Bloodhound checks the scent.

---

*Eagle passes the map to Bloodhound.*





























## Stage 2: BoodHount


Question: What standards of evidence should apply in Reality? How do we handle conflicting testimony where both parties claim different things happened?

**What this stage is:** This is where you test reality. Stage 1 gave you the map — who is fighting and what they are fighting about. But a map is not truth. Each party has their version of events. Their version might be accurate, mistaken, or deliberately false. Before you can judge (Stage 3) or decide (Stage 4), you must know what actually happened.

**Objective:** Establish what is true in each sub-conflict.

**Why:** You cannot make good decisions without knowing what is real. This stage separates fact from claim, action from word, and surfaces where the two diverge.

**Input:** The sub-conflicts identified in Stage 1.

**Output:** For each sub-conflict — verified facts, detected inaccuracies, and candidate wants (what each party actually appears to want, based on evidence).

**How to use:** Complete all four steps (CAPTURE → TEST → INFER → CHECK) for each sub-conflict identified in Stage 1. Work through one sub-conflict fully before moving to the next.

# The old draft asks: "For each party: what do they gain or lose if the conflict continues vs if it ends?"

---

## The Structure

For each sub-conflict from Stage 1, you do four moves:

| Move | Action | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| **1. CAPTURE** | Record what each party says vs what they do | Gather the raw data |
| **2. TEST** | Check claims against evidence | Separate truth from distortion |
| **3. INFER** | Hypothesise what each party actually wants | Surface hidden motives |
| **4. CHECK** | Challenge your own analysis | Protect against your bias |

---

## 1. CAPTURE
"When one party wants recognition, the other offers process" - this is impotant what do I do with this? is this this stage??????

**What to do:** For each party in the sub-conflict, record two things — what they SAY and what they DO.

**Why:** Truth hides in the gap between words and actions. You cannot see the gap until you lay them side by side.

**Definitions:**

| Element | Definition | Example |
|---------|------------|---------|
| **SAY** | What the party claims — about actions, facts, or reasons | "I didn't restrict contact" / "Adding you would expose my card details" |
| **DO** | What the party actually did — observable actions | Imposed 8pm restriction / Refused to add to Family Sharing |

**How:** Ask these questions:
- What does this party claim they did?
- What does this party claim is true (facts, explanations, reasons)?
- What did this party actually do? (Observable, documentable actions)


# STAGE 3: OWL JUDGEs

owl should have: who benefits question: and a table: Powerful Example Missing:
The "who drew the boundary" table:
Who drew the boundaryWhat they saidWho benefitsCourt"Hair is day-to-day — not your territory"FatherAppeal"Lives with is closed — don't revisit"FatherFather"There is no conflict"Father
This makes the "who drew the horizon" question concrete. ✗ MISSING
section 1 - move to Owl

### Owl Evaluates the Boundaries

Eagle mapped the fog, the forbidden, and the horizon. Owl now asks: **Who benefits from where those boundaries were drawn?**

| Who drew the boundary | What they said | Who benefits |
|-----------------------|----------------|--------------|
| | | |
| | | |
| | | |

**Example — Family Court:**

| Who drew the boundary | What they said | Who benefits |
|-----------------------|----------------|--------------|
| Court | "Hair is day-to-day — not your territory" | Father (pattern continues unexamined) |
| Appeal | "Lives with is closed — don't revisit" | Father (structural advantage locked in) |
| Father | "There is no conflict" | Father (if no conflict, no map needed) |

If the boundaries consistently benefit one party, that is data. Owl weighs it.


OPERATIONAL TO STRUCTURAL 

Not all conflicts look the same.

- **When one party denies the conflict:** They may call it "a process," "a determination," "a boundary," or "proof of your problem." What they call it instead is data. If one party says "there is no conflict" — that itself is data.

- **When a party has no face:** Institution

**Operational / Structural / Both** = Types of conflict. Eagle sees these. It's about *what kind of fight* this is.

**Enforcement** = Not a type. It's a *finding*. It requires:
1. Bloodhound to verify: "Was there an agreement? Was it followed?" (gap between said and done)
2. Owl to judge: "The agreement was violated."

So:

| What | Who | Why |
|------|-----|-----|
| Operational / Structural / Both | **Eagle** | Types the conflict — what kind of fight is this? |
| Enforcement gap | **Bloodhound** | Verifies — they said X, they did Y |
| Enforcement violation | **Owl** | Judges — the agreement was broken |

---

**Revised Eagle Note:**

> **Note:** Eagle sees not just *where* the fighting is, but *what kind* of fight it is. Two farmers at a stream:
> - **Operational** — disputing how many fish each gets (they agree who decides)
> - **Structural** — disputing who owns the fishing rights (authority contested)
> - **Both** — same fight every season (operational mask, structural underneath)
>
> The type determines what comes next. Wrong diagnosis, wrong tool.

---

**Enforcement lives downstream:**

Bloodhound sniffs: "They agreed on the catch. One took more."

Owl judges: "The agreement was violated."


Should htat be what the dog does??? of what Own should see???

> **Note:** Eagle sees not just *where* the fighting is, but *what kind* of fight it is. Two farmers at a stream:
> - **Operational** — disputing how many fish each gets (they agree who decides)
> - **Structural** — disputing who owns the fishing rights (authority contested)
> - **Both** — same fight every season (operational mask, structural underneath)
> - **Enforcement** — catch was agreed, one takes more anyway (gap between agreement and action)
>
> The type determines what comes next. Wrong diagnosis, wrong tool.


# A story on the Farmer's Fence:

Eagle flies high. From above, Eagle sees two kinds of fights:

Operational: Two farmers arguing over where to build the fence. They both accept it's their shared boundary. They just disagree on placement.
Structural: Two farmers arguing over whose land it is in the first place. No fence will hold until ownership is settled.
Both: They keep rebuilding the fence. It keeps getting torn down. Eagle notices the pattern: "They're not really fighting about the fence."
Option A: Disputed authority
"Who owns that strip of land?" → Structural. No fence will hold until ownership is settled.
Option B: Disputed process
"Who gets to decide where the fence goes?" → Structural. They might both accept it's a shared boundary, but neither accepts the other's right to place the fence unilaterally.
Option C: Refusal to comply
They actually agreed where the fence goes. One keeps tearing it down anyway. → Not structural. It's enforcement failure. The authority question is settled — one party just won't honour it.
Option D: Facts are disputed
They both accept it's a shared boundary, they both accept they should decide together — but they disagree about where the boundary actually is. → Operational. They need better information (a surveyor), not a different authority structure.

You're right to push. The fence keeps falling — but why?

**Option A: Disputed authority**
"Who owns that strip of land?" → Structural. No fence will hold until ownership is settled.

**Option B: Disputed process**
"Who gets to decide where the fence goes?" → Structural. They might both accept it's a shared boundary, but neither accepts the other's right to place the fence unilaterally.

**Option C: Refusal to comply**
They actually *agreed* where the fence goes. One keeps tearing it down anyway. → Not structural. It's enforcement failure. The authority question is settled — one party just won't honour it.

**Option D: Facts are disputed**
They both accept it's a shared boundary, they both accept they should decide together — but they disagree about where the boundary *actually is*. → Operational. They need better information (a surveyor), not a different authority structure.

---

So the recurring fence isn't automatically structural. Eagle has to ask: **Why does it keep falling?**

- Contested authority → Structural
- Contested facts → Operational (needs CHECK)
- Refusal to comply → Enforcement (needs ACT)

The Thermostat
Two people share a flat.
Operational: They agree they both live there. They disagree on the temperature. Eagle sees two people pointing at the dial, negotiating.
Structural: They disagree who controls the thermostat. One changed the password. Eagle sees two people pointing at each other, not at the dial.
Both: Every week, same fight. They agree on a setting. By Friday, it's changed. Eagle sees the pattern: "This isn't about temperature. It's about who holds the password."
Enforcement: They agreed on 20°C. One keeps changing it to 24°C anyway. Eagle sees the agreement, sees the override, sees the gap.

The Operational / Structural / Both / Enforcement framework goes in Owl, alongside the existing Levels (Level 1: What, Level 2: Who Decides, Level 3: How to Decide Together).
They're doing the same work — diagnosing depth.

One clarification:
Your existing Levels already cover this:

Operational ≈ Level 1
Structural ≈ Level 2 / Level 3
Enforcement = Owl judging: "Agreement existed. It was violated."

You may not need both frameworks. Or you merge them.



# OLD NOTES Stage 3: JUDGMENT

JUDGMENT identifies what must be addressed before you can move to resolution.
What must end.
What this stage is: This is where you evaluate what went wrong. Stage 2 (Truth) established what actually happened and what each party needs. But knowing what is true is not the same as knowing what failed, who is accountable, and what must be addressed before resolution is possible.
Objective: Identify what went wrong and what must be accounted for.
Why: You cannot resolve a conflict without understanding what caused it. This stage traces the gap between what should have happened and what did happen — whether through deception, concealment, neglect, mistakes, or miscommunication.
Input: The verified truth from Stage 2 — facts, events, needs, and interests.
Output: Assessment of violations, failures, unmet needs, and accountability.
Type: Evaluative (backward-looking)
Question: What went wrong? What must be addressed? Who is accountable?


GapWhat it judgesWrongWhat was violated (rules, agreements, trust)HiddenWhat was concealed (facts, motives, truth)MissedWhat was ignored (needs, fears, wants — both legitimate unmet needs AND misaligned wants)

What JUDGMENT Evaluates
JUDGMENT identifies the gap between truth and what was presented, acted upon, or suppressed:
CategoryQuestionDeceptionWhat was lied about?ConcealmentWhat was hidden?NeglectWhat needs were ignored or dismissed?MistakesWhat errors were made?MiscommunicationWhat was misunderstood or poorly communicated?AccountabilityWho bears responsibility, and for what?

The Evaluation Process
For each sub-conflict, ask:

What should have happened? (Based on rules, agreements, reasonable expectations)
What actually happened? (Established in Stage 2)
Where is the gap?
What caused the gap? (Deception / Concealment / Neglect / Mistakes / Miscommunication)
Who is responsible?
What must be addressed before resolution is possible?


JUDGMENT — Fill in (per sub-conflict):
Sub-conflictWhat should have happenedWhat actually happenedThe gapCauseWho is responsibleWhat must be addressed

Stage 3 Output
At the end of Stage 3, you have:

✓ Violations identified (deception, concealment)
✓ Failures identified (neglect, mistakes, miscommunication)
✓ Unmet needs identified
✓ Accountability assigned (who is responsible for what)
✓ What must be addressed before resolution is possible


The Link to Stage 4
Stage 3 tells you what went wrong — the violations, failures, and accountability.


DECISION answers: Of what is possible, what do we choose to do?
DECISION is about resolving the conflict. How do we address the original conflict that we mapped in Stage 1?

## The Three Tests: Philosophical Foundation

The three tests are not arbitrary. They represent the three major traditions of ethical reasoning, ensuring comprehensive evaluation from multiple angles:

| Test | Philosophical Tradition | Domain | Core Question |
|------|------------------------|--------|---------------|
| **L.E.R** | Deontological (Kant, rules) | Permissibility in principle | Is it RIGHT? |
| **B.U.S** | Consequentialist (utility) | Prudence and effects | Is it WISE? |
| **A.C.T** | Pragmatic (feasibility) | Practical execution | Is it DOABLE? |

Together, these tests prevent common decision pitfalls: doing something legal but unwise, wise but impossible, or possible but wrong.

---

## Overview: The Three Tests

| Test | Name | Acronym | Question | Finds what's wrong with |
|------|------|---------|----------|------------------------|
| **1** | RIGHT | L.E.R | Is this RIGHT? | The PRINCIPLE |
| **2** | WISE | B.U.S | Is this WISE? | The OUTCOME |
| **3** | DOABLE | A.C.T | Is this DOABLE? | The EXECUTION |

---

## Test 1: RIGHT — Is this RIGHT?

### L.E.R TEST

**Aim:** To determine if the WANT is fundamentally LEGITIMATE and permissible in principle.

| Letter | Name | Function | Focus Question |
|--------|------|----------|----------------|
| **L** | LEGAL | Rules Check | Is the WANT ALLOWED by laws, regulations, contracts, or formal agreements? |
| **E** | ETHICAL | Morality Check | Is the WANT MORALLY RIGHT? (fair, safe, respectful, not harmful) |
| **R** | REVERSIBLE | Mirror Check | Would I accept this WANT if applied TO ME? (Verifies L and E) |

### The Mirror Check (R): Why It Matters

The Reversible test — "Would I accept this if applied to me?" — is the ultimate gut-check. It catches self-serving rationalisations that slip through abstract ethical reasoning. People can justify almost anything in the abstract, but when forced to imagine the same treatment applied to themselves, hypocrisy becomes visible.

This test operationalises what philosophers call the Golden Rule — one of the oldest and most universal ethical principles in human history.

### The Golden Rule: Universal Foundation

The principle of treating others as one would wish to be treated appears independently across virtually all human cultures and traditions:

- **Confucius (551–479 BCE):** "Do not do to others what you do not want them to do to you."
- **Buddhism:** "Hurt not others in ways that you yourself would find hurtful."
- **Judaism (Hillel):** "What is hateful to you, do not do to your fellow."
- **Christianity (Matthew 7:12):** "Do to others what you would have them do to you."
- **Islam:** "None of you truly believes until he loves for his brother what he loves for himself."

This near-universal presence suggests the principle arises from basic human empathy and the requirements of social cooperation. The Mirror Check harnesses this ancient wisdom as a practical test.

---

## Test 2: WISE — Is this WISE?

### B.U.S TEST

**Aim:** To determine if the WANT produces GOOD OUTCOMES across impact, scale, and time.

| Letter | Name | Function | Focus Question |
|--------|------|----------|----------------|
| **B** | BENEFIT | Impact Check | Who gains? Who loses? Is there net positive impact? |
| **U** | UNIVERSAL | Scale Check | Would the positive effects still hold if everyone adopted this WANT? |
| **S** | SUSTAINABLE | Duration Check | Do the positive effects last over time? |

This test evaluates consequences. Something can be legally permitted and ethically defensible in principle, yet still be unwise — producing more harm than benefit, working only if others don't do it, or creating short-term gains that collapse over time.

---

## Test 3: DOABLE — Is this DOABLE?

### A.C.T TEST

**Aim:** To determine if the WANT is FEASIBLE and can actually be executed.

| Letter | Name | Function | Focus Question |
|--------|------|----------|----------------|
| **A** | ASSETS | Resources Check | Are the necessary resources available? (money, time, people, tools) |
| **C** | CAPABILITY | Execution Check | Can the steps actually be carried out? (skills, process, authority) |
| **T** | TIMELY | Timing Check | Is it achievable within the required timeframe and current constraints? |

This test is purely practical. It does not judge whether the WANT is right or wise — only whether it can actually happen given current resources, capabilities, and constraints.

## The Decision Rule: Hierarchy of Tests

> **CRITICAL RULE**
>
> Reject any WANT that fails L.E.R or B.U.S, even if A.C.T passes.
>
> Only among WANTs that pass the first two tests should you use A.C.T to choose or plan implementation.

This hierarchy is essential. Without it, people justify wrong actions because they are easy. The tests must be applied in order:

1. **L.E.R first** — Is it RIGHT in principle?
2. **B.U.S second** — Is it WISE in outcomes?
3. **A.C.T last** — Is it DOABLE in practice?

A WANT that fails L.E.R or B.U.S is rejected — full stop. The fact that it passes A.C.T ("we can get away with it") is irrelevant. A.C.T only matters for WANTs that have already passed the first two tests.

## Worked Example: Phone Conflict

Two parents in a custody dispute disagree about phone parental controls. Each has a WANT. Let's test them.

### Father's WANT: Separate Control

*"I will set parental controls independently during my parenting time, without consulting Mother."*

| Test | Result | Reasoning |
|------|--------|-----------|
| **L (Legal)** | ✗ Fails | Violates court order (Schedule G) requiring joint decision-making |
| **E (Ethical)** | ✗ Fails | Unfair to child (inconsistent rules) and mother (excluded from decision) |
| **R (Reversible)** | ✗ Fails | Would father accept mother unilaterally overriding his decisions? No. |
| **B.U.S** | ✗ Fails | Child loses (inconsistency), not sustainable, not universal |
| **A.C.T** | ✓ Passes | Already happening — easy to execute |

**Verdict:** EASY but WRONG. Fails L.E.R and B.U.S. The fact that it passes A.C.T is irrelevant.

---

### Mother's WANT: Shared Control

*"We will agree on consistent parental controls that apply in both homes."*

| Test | Result | Reasoning |
|------|--------|-----------|
| **L (Legal)** | ✓ Passes | Complies with court order requiring joint decision-making |
| **E (Ethical)** | ✓ Passes | Fair to child (consistency) and both parents (equal input) |
| **R (Reversible)** | ✓ Passes | Mother would accept shared decision-making applied to her? Yes. |
| **B.U.S** | ✓ Passes | Child benefits, sustainable over time, works if universalised |
| **A.C.T** | ⚠ Partial | Requires father's cooperation — implementation barrier |

**Verdict:** RIGHT but HARD. Passes L.E.R and B.U.S. The partial A.C.T result tells us what's needed for implementation — not whether the WANT should be chosen.

---

### What the Tests Reveal

| Father's Position | Mother's Position |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Easy but WRONG** | **Right but HARD** |

The decision becomes clear: **The WANT that passes L.E.R and B.U.S should be chosen. A.C.T tells you what's needed to IMPLEMENT it.**

---

## Stage 3 Output

At the end of Stage 3, you have:

- ✓ Each candidate WANT tested against L.E.R (Right)
- ✓ Each candidate WANT tested against B.U.S (Wise)
- ✓ Each candidate WANT tested against A.C.T (Doable)
- ✓ Clear verdict: which WANTs pass, which fail, and why
- ✓ Implementation barriers identified (from A.C.T results)

---

## The Link to Stage 4

Stage 3 tells you what OUGHT to be — which WANTs are right and wise.

But knowing what ought to be is not the same as choosing to do it.

Stage 4 (Decision) takes the evaluated WANTs and asks: Given what is right and wise, what will you actually commit to doing? This is where judgment becomes intention.

## Working Template: Stage 3 Grid

Use this grid to evaluate each candidate WANT from Stage 2:

| WANT | L.E.R | B.U.S | A.C.T | Verdict |
|------|-------|-------|-------|---------|
| Party A's WANT | ✓ / ✗ / ⚠ | ✓ / ✗ / ⚠ | ✓ / ✗ / ⚠ | Pass / Fail / Notes |
| Party B's WANT | ✓ / ✗ / ⚠ | ✓ / ✗ / ⚠ | ✓ / ✗ / ⚠ | Pass / Fail / Notes |

**Remember:** A WANT must pass L.E.R AND B.U.S to be considered. A.C.T only determines implementation, not selection.

---

DECISION answers: Of what is possible, what do we choose to do?
DECISION is about resolving the conflict. How do we address the original conflict that we mapped in Stage 1?

## The Three Tests: Philosophical Foundation

The three tests are not arbitrary. They represent the three major traditions of ethical reasoning, ensuring comprehensive evaluation from multiple angles:

| Test | Philosophical Tradition | Domain | Core Question |
|------|------------------------|--------|---------------|
| **L.E.R** | Deontological (Kant, rules) | Permissibility in principle | Is it RIGHT? |
| **B.U.S** | Consequentialist (utility) | Prudence and effects | Is it WISE? |
| **A.C.T** | Pragmatic (feasibility) | Practical execution | Is it DOABLE? |

Together, these tests prevent common decision pitfalls: doing something legal but unwise, wise but impossible, or possible but wrong.

---

## Overview: The Three Tests

| Test | Name | Acronym | Question | Finds what's wrong with |
|------|------|---------|----------|------------------------|
| **1** | RIGHT | L.E.R | Is this RIGHT? | The PRINCIPLE |
| **2** | WISE | B.U.S | Is this WISE? | The OUTCOME |
| **3** | DOABLE | A.C.T | Is this DOABLE? | The EXECUTION |

---

## Test 1: RIGHT — Is this RIGHT?

### L.E.R TEST

**Aim:** To determine if the WANT is fundamentally LEGITIMATE and permissible in principle.

| Letter | Name | Function | Focus Question |
|--------|------|----------|----------------|
| **L** | LEGAL | Rules Check | Is the WANT ALLOWED by laws, regulations, contracts, or formal agreements? |
| **E** | ETHICAL | Morality Check | Is the WANT MORALLY RIGHT? (fair, safe, respectful, not harmful) |
| **R** | REVERSIBLE | Mirror Check | Would I accept this WANT if applied TO ME? (Verifies L and E) |

### The Mirror Check (R): Why It Matters

The Reversible test — "Would I accept this if applied to me?" — is the ultimate gut-check. It catches self-serving rationalisations that slip through abstract ethical reasoning. People can justify almost anything in the abstract, but when forced to imagine the same treatment applied to themselves, hypocrisy becomes visible.

This test operationalises what philosophers call the Golden Rule — one of the oldest and most universal ethical principles in human history.

### The Golden Rule: Universal Foundation

The principle of treating others as one would wish to be treated appears independently across virtually all human cultures and traditions:

- **Confucius (551–479 BCE):** "Do not do to others what you do not want them to do to you."
- **Buddhism:** "Hurt not others in ways that you yourself would find hurtful."
- **Judaism (Hillel):** "What is hateful to you, do not do to your fellow."
- **Christianity (Matthew 7:12):** "Do to others what you would have them do to you."
- **Islam:** "None of you truly believes until he loves for his brother what he loves for himself."

This near-universal presence suggests the principle arises from basic human empathy and the requirements of social cooperation. The Mirror Check harnesses this ancient wisdom as a practical test.

---

## Test 2: WISE — Is this WISE?

### B.U.S TEST

**Aim:** To determine if the WANT produces GOOD OUTCOMES across impact, scale, and time.

| Letter | Name | Function | Focus Question |
|--------|------|----------|----------------|
| **B** | BENEFIT | Impact Check | Who gains? Who loses? Is there net positive impact? |
| **U** | UNIVERSAL | Scale Check | Would the positive effects still hold if everyone adopted this WANT? |
| **S** | SUSTAINABLE | Duration Check | Do the positive effects last over time? |

This test evaluates consequences. Something can be legally permitted and ethically defensible in principle, yet still be unwise — producing more harm than benefit, working only if others don't do it, or creating short-term gains that collapse over time.

---

## Test 3: DOABLE — Is this DOABLE?

### A.C.T TEST

**Aim:** To determine if the WANT is FEASIBLE and can actually be executed.

| Letter | Name | Function | Focus Question |
|--------|------|----------|----------------|
| **A** | ASSETS | Resources Check | Are the necessary resources available? (money, time, people, tools) |
| **C** | CAPABILITY | Execution Check | Can the steps actually be carried out? (skills, process, authority) |
| **T** | TIMELY | Timing Check | Is it achievable within the required timeframe and current constraints? |

This test is purely practical. It does not judge whether the WANT is right or wise — only whether it can actually happen given current resources, capabilities, and constraints.

But knowing what went wrong is not the same as knowing how to fix it.
Stage 4 (Decision) asks: Given what went wrong and who is accountable, how do we resolve the conflict we mapped in Stage 1?
JUDGMENT is backward-looking (what happened). DECISION is forward-looking (what to do).
## 2.8 Why You Play All Roles

No one else will — and no one else can.

In real conflicts, the five stages are almost always split across different people. Each does their fragment, but no single person is responsible for genuine resolution. No one is truly invested in ending the conflict — only in discharging their assigned role.

In a courtroom, for example:

- The judge JUDGES — but only based on what's presented
- The lawyers CHECK — but biased toward winning for their client
- The parties DECIDE — but only between the narrow options the system allows, and usually from exhaustion rather than clarity
- Enforcement ACTS — mechanically, carrying out orders rather than resolving anything
- And crucially, no one MAPS — no one names the full system: the hidden stakeholders, the structural forces, the unspoken patterns everyone pretends aren't there

Because the work is fragmented — and no one owns the whole — the root cause survives. You might "win," yet still feel hollow. The same fight returns in a new form. Or you lose and never understand why, leaving you powerless to prevent the next round.

This framework doesn't ask you to replace the judge, the lawyers, or the system. It asks you to do the full cycle yourself — in parallel — so you see what they miss, anticipate any outcome, and know exactly what to do next no matter what they decide.

When you hold the whole map in your own hands, you become the one person in the room who isn't surprised, isn't trapped, and sees clearly — whether you win, lose, or walk away.

And the most important part: You don't end up where you started. Each cycle, you evolve. The conflict changes. Your understanding deepens. Or the problem actually ends.
