## 4. Stage 1: MAP

## 4.1. WHAT WE LEARNT FROM A CHEAT SHEET 

**EAGLE — MAPs**

**Eagle Maps the Terrain**

*Because you cannot navigate a field you haven't named.*

- What's the conflict?
- Where are the friction points?
- Who are the parties? Am I a party?
- Who is visible? Am I visible?
- Who is hiding? Am I hiding?

*Focus is not on the "True." Focus is on the "Entire."*


Eagle flies at 10,000 feet. It doesn't look for the "truth" yet — that is Bloodhound's job. Eagle looks for the boundaries. It must name how EACH party sees the conflict. If it only map one perspective, the map has been drawn before Eagle flew."

Eagle's enemy is the Fog of War. When you are flooded, the conflict is everywhere and nowhere. Eagle blows the fog away so you can see that the "World-Ending War" is actually a specific dispute over a specific boundary.

Eagle also watches for the map you drew before you looked — the story you already believe, the players you already cast. If your map was drawn before Eagle flew, Eagle is just decorating your assumptions.

Eagle looks for the Hidden Player: the mother-in-law who isn't in the room but is in the conversation; the boss who hasn't spoken but whose shadow is on the table.

> **Note:** Eagle asks: Is this a fight about *what* — or about *who decides*?
>
> Most people fight about the "what" (the fish, the money, the chores). But if the fight keeps returning, the "what" is a decoy. The real conflict is the authority — who has the right to decide. If "who decides" isn't settled, the "what" will never stay fixed.
>
> Eagle checks Eagle: Am I looking at the whole field, or only the part that makes me look like the victim? Am I zoomed in so tight I've lost the horizon? Am I an Eagle or more like a Vulture (the shadow) — "only circling for carcasses, hunting the other's faults, not mapping the whole."
> 
> **Note on Fog and Forbidden Zones:**
Eagle identifies gaps: "Here is fog — I cannot see this territory." "Here is forbidden — I was told not to fly here."
Owl evaluates gaps: "What does the fog conceal?" "What does the forbidden zone cost?" "Is the absence from the map itself data?"
Eagle maps the hole. Owl judges what the hole means.
>
> Eagle passes the map to Bloodhound.





**Operational / Structural / Both** = Types of conflict. Eagle sees these. It's about *what kind of fight* this is.

**Enforcement** = Not a type. It's a *finding*. It requires:
1. Bloodhound to verify: "Was there an agreement? Was it followed?" (gap between said and done)
2. Owl to judge: "The agreement was violated."

So:

| What | Who | Why |
|------|-----|-----|
| Operational / Structural / Both | **Eagle** | Types the conflict — what kind of fight is this? |
| Enforcement gap | **Bloodhound** | Verifies — they said X, they did Y |
| Enforcement violation | **Owl** | Judges — the agreement was broken |

---

**Revised Eagle Note:**

> **Note:** Eagle sees not just *where* the fighting is, but *what kind* of fight it is. Two farmers at a stream:
> - **Operational** — disputing how many fish each gets (they agree who decides)
> - **Structural** — disputing who owns the fishing rights (authority contested)
> - **Both** — same fight every season (operational mask, structural underneath)
>
> The type determines what comes next. Wrong diagnosis, wrong tool.

---

**Enforcement lives downstream:**

Bloodhound sniffs: "They agreed on the catch. One took more."

Owl judges: "The agreement was violated."


Should htat be what the dog does??? of what Own should see???

> **Note:** Eagle sees not just *where* the fighting is, but *what kind* of fight it is. Two farmers at a stream:
> - **Operational** — disputing how many fish each gets (they agree who decides)
> - **Structural** — disputing who owns the fishing rights (authority contested)
> - **Both** — same fight every season (operational mask, structural underneath)
> - **Enforcement** — catch was agreed, one takes more anyway (gap between agreement and action)
>
> The type determines what comes next. Wrong diagnosis, wrong tool.


# A story on the Farmer's Fence:

Eagle flies high. From above, Eagle sees two kinds of fights:

Operational: Two farmers arguing over where to build the fence. They both accept it's their shared boundary. They just disagree on placement.
Structural: Two farmers arguing over whose land it is in the first place. No fence will hold until ownership is settled.
Both: They keep rebuilding the fence. It keeps getting torn down. Eagle notices the pattern: "They're not really fighting about the fence."
Option A: Disputed authority
"Who owns that strip of land?" → Structural. No fence will hold until ownership is settled.
Option B: Disputed process
"Who gets to decide where the fence goes?" → Structural. They might both accept it's a shared boundary, but neither accepts the other's right to place the fence unilaterally.
Option C: Refusal to comply
They actually agreed where the fence goes. One keeps tearing it down anyway. → Not structural. It's enforcement failure. The authority question is settled — one party just won't honour it.
Option D: Facts are disputed
They both accept it's a shared boundary, they both accept they should decide together — but they disagree about where the boundary actually is. → Operational. They need better information (a surveyor), not a different authority structure.

You're right to push. The fence keeps falling — but why?

**Option A: Disputed authority**
"Who owns that strip of land?" → Structural. No fence will hold until ownership is settled.

**Option B: Disputed process**
"Who gets to decide where the fence goes?" → Structural. They might both accept it's a shared boundary, but neither accepts the other's right to place the fence unilaterally.

**Option C: Refusal to comply**
They actually *agreed* where the fence goes. One keeps tearing it down anyway. → Not structural. It's enforcement failure. The authority question is settled — one party just won't honour it.

**Option D: Facts are disputed**
They both accept it's a shared boundary, they both accept they should decide together — but they disagree about where the boundary *actually is*. → Operational. They need better information (a surveyor), not a different authority structure.

---

So the recurring fence isn't automatically structural. Eagle has to ask: **Why does it keep falling?**

- Contested authority → Structural
- Contested facts → Operational (needs CHECK)
- Refusal to comply → Enforcement (needs ACT)

The Thermostat
Two people share a flat.
Operational: They agree they both live there. They disagree on the temperature. Eagle sees two people pointing at the dial, negotiating.
Structural: They disagree who controls the thermostat. One changed the password. Eagle sees two people pointing at each other, not at the dial.
Both: Every week, same fight. They agree on a setting. By Friday, it's changed. Eagle sees the pattern: "This isn't about temperature. It's about who holds the password."
Enforcement: They agreed on 20°C. One keeps changing it to 24°C anyway. Eagle sees the agreement, sees the override, sees the gap.








**What this stage is:** This is the foundation for understanding and solving conflicts. Before you can analyse or resolve anything, you must first define what you are dealing with. This stage focuses on naming what is on the map: 

**A) Parties** (who is involved) and 
**B) Conflict** (what they are fighting about).

It is the simplest part of the process — yet it is often skipped or done carelessly. If you get the map wrong, everything that follows will be wrong too.

**Objective:** Draw the map of the conflict before you analyse it.

**Why:** You cannot analyse what you haven't defined. This stage sets the boundaries. Everything in later stages (Stage 1: Truth, Stage 2: Judgment, Stage 3: Decision) will rest on the clarity of the componets you identified. If you skip this, your analysis will drift.

**Output:** A one-page map showing: Parties and Conflict — both named, categorised, and typed.

A note on criticality:
The framework requires a critical mass of defined elements to work: Parties and Conflict, both named, categorised, and typed.
If you skip parties, you miss who is sustaining the conflict.
If you skip sub-conflicts, you have a label but nothing to analyse.
If you skip types, you will use the wrong tool.
Miss any of these, and your analysis is sub-critical — it will not yield insight. It will fizzle.
Stage 0 is the move to supercriticality: defining the boundaries so clearly that the conflict's structure becomes visible and inevitable.

A note on symmetry:
Stage 1 (Truth) requires symmetrical pressure — equal scrutiny applied to all parties' claims and all sub-conflicts.
Any asymmetry — favouring one party's narrative, ignoring one sub-conflict — prevents the core truth from being revealed.
Bias is not just unfair. It is inefficient. It produces a distorted map and a failed resolution.

A note on staging:
The visible fights (Operational) are the primary explosions — loud, obvious, immediate.
The hidden fight (Structural) is the secondary — the sustained power source underneath.
The framework forces you to use the energy from analysing the visible to reach and address the structural core.
If you only resolve operational disputes, the conflict will reignite. You have not reached the secondary.

---

## The Structure

This stage clarifies two things: **A. Parties** and **B. Conflict**

For each, you do three moves: **Name → Categorise → Type**

| Move | A. PARTIES | B. CONFLICT |
|------|------------|-------------|
| **1. Name** | List who is involved | Name the main conflict |
| **2. Categorise** | Main / Sub | Main conflict / Sub-conflicts |
| **3. Type** | Benefits / Loses / Both / ? | Operational / Structural / Both |

---

## A. PARTIES

### A1. Name

**What to do:** List everyone connected to the conflict.

**Why:** Conflicts persist because of parties you don't see. The visible fighters are easy to spot. The hidden beneficiaries are why the conflict won't end.

**How:** Ask these questions:
1. Who is visibly fighting?
2. Who else is connected but not visibly fighting?
3. For each party: what do they gain or lose if the conflict **continues** vs if it **ends**?

---

### A2. Categorise

**What to do:** Categorise each party by their level of visibility.

**Definitions:**

| Level | Definition |
|-------|------------|
| **Main** | Parties who visibly take actions inside the conflict |
| **Sub** | Parties who influence outcomes without taking visible action |

---

### A3. Type

**What to do:** Classify each party by their interest in the conflict continuing.

**Definitions:**

| Type | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Benefits** | Gains if conflict continues — they have no reason to end it |
| **Loses** | Harmed if conflict continues — they want it to end |
| **Both** | Gains something AND loses something — the conflict continues because what they gain is worth more to them than what they lose |
| **?** | Unclear — flag for Stage 1 |

**Why classify interests?** This tells you who wants peace and who doesn't. "Benefits" parties want the conflict to continue. "Loses" parties want it to end. "Both" parties are stuck in a trade-off — they tolerate the loss because they value the gain more.

---

### A. PARTIES — Fill in:

| Party | Level | Type | Notes |
|-------|-------|------|-------|
| *(example: Russia)* | Main | Both | Gains buffer zone, loses economic ties |
| | | | |
| | | | |
| | | | |

**Notes guidance:** Surface observations only. If the party is an organisation, you may note: who is the human decision-maker?

**When to stop:** You have listed everyone you can think of. Only include actors who could conceivably change their behaviour if the conflict ended. You can always add more later if Stage 1 reveals hidden parties.

---

## B. CONFLICT

### B1. Name

**What to do:** Name what the main parties are fighting about.

**Why:** This is the container. Everything else sits inside it. If you name it wrong, your whole analysis is off.

**How:** Ask — what would a newspaper headline say?

**The Test:** If this were resolved, would the current round of fighting visibly end?

**Definition:**

| Main Conflict |
|---------------|
| The visible, current, external fight. Not the history. Not the hidden causes. Just what you can see they are fighting about right now. |

**Non-examples (too abstract):**

| Wrong (analysis) | Right (map) |
|------------------|-------------|
| "Incompatible worldviews" | "Dispute over custody arrangements" |
| "Lack of trust" | "War in Ukraine" |
| "Control issues" | "Disagreement over phone rules" |

---

### B2. Categorise

**What to do:** List the specific fights inside the main conflict.

**Why:** The main conflict is the container. Sub-conflicts are what's inside. You will analyse each one separately in Stage 1.

**How:** Ask — what exactly are they fighting about? What are the individual disputes?

**Definition:**

| Sub-conflict |
|--------------|
| A specific, concrete disagreement. Something you could point to and say "they are fighting about this." |

**Aim for 3–6.** Fewer = under-mapped. More = too granular.

If you have more than 6: group similar ones together, or check if some belong in a different main conflict.

**Sanity check:** Each sub-conflict must obviously sit inside the main conflict. If it doesn't, rewrite the main conflict — or park that dispute for a separate map.

---

### B3. Type

**What to do:** Classify each sub-conflict.

**Why:** The type tells you how hard it will be to resolve and what kind of solution is needed.

**How:** Ask — is this fight about what to do, or about who gets to decide?

**Definitions:**

| Type | Definition | How to recognise |
|------|------------|------------------|
| **Operational** | They agree who decides. They disagree about what to do. | "We both have authority, we just disagree on the approach." |
| **Structural** | They disagree about who has the right to decide. | "I don't accept your authority" or "Who controls this?" |
| **Both** | Operational on the surface, but it keeps recurring because the structural question is unresolved. | Fights that never stay solved. |

**Why classify type?** Because you cannot fix a conflict using the wrong tool. If it's operational, you can negotiate the rule. If it's structural, you first have to agree who gets to decide — otherwise every rule you make will be fought again.

**Triggers for "Both":**
- A party frames it as a "matter of principle" or "this sets a precedent"
- Resolving the operational issue wouldn't actually stop this fight recurring

---

### B. CONFLICT — Fill in:

| Main Conflict |
|---------------|
| |

| Sub-conflict | Type |
|--------------|------|
| | Operational / Structural / Both |
| | Operational / Structural / Both |
| | Operational / Structural / Both |
| | Operational / Structural / Both |
| | Operational / Structural / Both |
| | Operational / Structural / Both |

---

## Stage 0 Output Checklist

Before moving to Stage 1 (TRUTH), confirm:

**A. Parties:**
- ✓ Named (listed all parties)
- ✓ Categorised (Main / Sub)
- ✓ Typed (Benefits / Loses / Both / ?)

**B. Conflict:**
- ✓ Named (main conflict passes newspaper test)
- ✓ Categorised (3–6 sub-conflicts, each inside the main conflict)
- ✓ Typed (each sub-conflict: Operational / Structural / Both)

---

## What You Now Have

You have your map:

- **A. Parties** — who is involved, how visible they are (Main/Sub), and what their interest is (Benefits/Loses/Both)
- **B. Conflict** — what they are fighting about (main conflict), what the specific disputes are (sub-conflicts), and what type each dispute is (Operational/Structural/Both)

**But you don't know what's actually true.**

Each party has their version. Their version might be accurate, or wrong, or a lie, or a misunderstanding.

**To know what to do, you need to know what's true.**

---

## Why Zoom Into Sub-Conflicts?

The main conflict ("custody dispute" or "war in Ukraine") is too big to analyse directly. You cannot find truth at that level — it's just a label.

Truth lives in the specific disputes:
- Not "custody dispute" → but "the phone disagreement on 15 November"
- Not "war in Ukraine" → but "what happened in Bucha"

Each sub-conflict is where claims are made, actions are taken, and truth can be tested.

**Stage 0 is the view from above** — you see the whole territory.
**Stage 1 zooms in** — you walk into each sub-conflict and see what actually happened.

---

## The Link to Stage 1

**Stage 0 gives you the map** — who is playing, what they're fighting about, and what type of fight it is.

**But you cannot act on a map. You can only act on truth.**

**Stage 1 zooms into each sub-conflict, one by one, to find the truth:** what actually happened vs what is claimed.

Stage 1 asks, for each sub-conflict:
1. What happened? (the events)
2. What does each party say happened? (the claims)
3. Do they match?
4. Where they don't match — is it a lie, a mistake, a misunderstanding, or something hidden?

**Only when you know what is true (Stage 1) can you judge (Stage 2) and decide what to do (Stage 3).**


* The map may be revised as Stage 1 reveals new parties, conflicts, or information
* Note: The map reflects the map-maker's perspective. Different parties may draw different maps.



Instruction: 
Imagine you are giving Stage 0 to someone who knows nothing about the conflict and nothing about the framework. Your job is to tell them exactly what Stage 0 is and how to complete it.

Stage 0 should explain:
What Stage 0 is:
It is the step where they Name the Map — meaning:
What is on the map? (the conflicts)
Who is on the map? (the parties)

What they need to produce:
A clear map of the conflict with defined parties, defined conflicts, and correct classifications.

How they should do it:
You must guide them with:
How (instructions)
Why (the purpose behind each instruction)
Definitions (so nothing depends on interpretation)
Questions they can ask themselves to generate the right content

What the instructions must achieve:
The instructions must be:
Logical — each step follows naturally; no one questions the reasoning
Simple — they always know what action to take; zero confusion
Precise — every term and category is clearly defined; no ambiguity
Complete — nothing important is missing; they have everything they need
Bounded — they know exactly when they are finished; they don’t overwork the step

Finally Each Stage must logicallly connect to the next: e.g. We drew a Map in stage 0 so that... in stage 1, 2, 3: truth, judge, decide.....



## Stage 2: BoodHount


Question: What standards of evidence should apply in Reality? How do we handle conflicting testimony where both parties claim different things happened?

**What this stage is:** This is where you test reality. Stage 1 gave you the map — who is fighting and what they are fighting about. But a map is not truth. Each party has their version of events. Their version might be accurate, mistaken, or deliberately false. Before you can judge (Stage 3) or decide (Stage 4), you must know what actually happened.

**Objective:** Establish what is true in each sub-conflict.

**Why:** You cannot make good decisions without knowing what is real. This stage separates fact from claim, action from word, and surfaces where the two diverge.

**Input:** The sub-conflicts identified in Stage 1.

**Output:** For each sub-conflict — verified facts, detected inaccuracies, and candidate wants (what each party actually appears to want, based on evidence).

**How to use:** Complete all four steps (CAPTURE → TEST → INFER → CHECK) for each sub-conflict identified in Stage 1. Work through one sub-conflict fully before moving to the next.

---

## The Structure

For each sub-conflict from Stage 1, you do four moves:

| Move | Action | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| **1. CAPTURE** | Record what each party says vs what they do | Gather the raw data |
| **2. TEST** | Check claims against evidence | Separate truth from distortion |
| **3. INFER** | Hypothesise what each party actually wants | Surface hidden motives |
| **4. CHECK** | Challenge your own analysis | Protect against your bias |

---

## 1. CAPTURE

**What to do:** For each party in the sub-conflict, record two things — what they SAY and what they DO.

**Why:** Truth hides in the gap between words and actions. You cannot see the gap until you lay them side by side.

**Definitions:**

| Element | Definition | Example |
|---------|------------|---------|
| **SAY** | What the party claims — about actions, facts, or reasons | "I didn't restrict contact" / "Adding you would expose my card details" |
| **DO** | What the party actually did — observable actions | Imposed 8pm restriction / Refused to add to Family Sharing |

**How:** Ask these questions:
- What does this party claim they did?
- What does this party claim is true (facts, explanations, reasons)?
- What did this party actually do? (Observable, documentable actions)


Stage 3: JUDGMENT
JUDGMENT identifies what must be addressed before you can move to resolution.
What must end.
What this stage is: This is where you evaluate what went wrong. Stage 2 (Truth) established what actually happened and what each party needs. But knowing what is true is not the same as knowing what failed, who is accountable, and what must be addressed before resolution is possible.
Objective: Identify what went wrong and what must be accounted for.
Why: You cannot resolve a conflict without understanding what caused it. This stage traces the gap between what should have happened and what did happen — whether through deception, concealment, neglect, mistakes, or miscommunication.
Input: The verified truth from Stage 2 — facts, events, needs, and interests.
Output: Assessment of violations, failures, unmet needs, and accountability.
Type: Evaluative (backward-looking)
Question: What went wrong? What must be addressed? Who is accountable?


GapWhat it judgesWrongWhat was violated (rules, agreements, trust)HiddenWhat was concealed (facts, motives, truth)MissedWhat was ignored (needs, fears, wants — both legitimate unmet needs AND misaligned wants)

What JUDGMENT Evaluates
JUDGMENT identifies the gap between truth and what was presented, acted upon, or suppressed:
CategoryQuestionDeceptionWhat was lied about?ConcealmentWhat was hidden?NeglectWhat needs were ignored or dismissed?MistakesWhat errors were made?MiscommunicationWhat was misunderstood or poorly communicated?AccountabilityWho bears responsibility, and for what?

The Evaluation Process
For each sub-conflict, ask:

What should have happened? (Based on rules, agreements, reasonable expectations)
What actually happened? (Established in Stage 2)
Where is the gap?
What caused the gap? (Deception / Concealment / Neglect / Mistakes / Miscommunication)
Who is responsible?
What must be addressed before resolution is possible?


JUDGMENT — Fill in (per sub-conflict):
Sub-conflictWhat should have happenedWhat actually happenedThe gapCauseWho is responsibleWhat must be addressed

Stage 3 Output
At the end of Stage 3, you have:

✓ Violations identified (deception, concealment)
✓ Failures identified (neglect, mistakes, miscommunication)
✓ Unmet needs identified
✓ Accountability assigned (who is responsible for what)
✓ What must be addressed before resolution is possible


The Link to Stage 4
Stage 3 tells you what went wrong — the violations, failures, and accountability.


DECISION answers: Of what is possible, what do we choose to do?
DECISION is about resolving the conflict. How do we address the original conflict that we mapped in Stage 1?

## The Three Tests: Philosophical Foundation

The three tests are not arbitrary. They represent the three major traditions of ethical reasoning, ensuring comprehensive evaluation from multiple angles:

| Test | Philosophical Tradition | Domain | Core Question |
|------|------------------------|--------|---------------|
| **L.E.R** | Deontological (Kant, rules) | Permissibility in principle | Is it RIGHT? |
| **B.U.S** | Consequentialist (utility) | Prudence and effects | Is it WISE? |
| **A.C.T** | Pragmatic (feasibility) | Practical execution | Is it DOABLE? |

Together, these tests prevent common decision pitfalls: doing something legal but unwise, wise but impossible, or possible but wrong.

---

## Overview: The Three Tests

| Test | Name | Acronym | Question | Finds what's wrong with |
|------|------|---------|----------|------------------------|
| **1** | RIGHT | L.E.R | Is this RIGHT? | The PRINCIPLE |
| **2** | WISE | B.U.S | Is this WISE? | The OUTCOME |
| **3** | DOABLE | A.C.T | Is this DOABLE? | The EXECUTION |

---

## Test 1: RIGHT — Is this RIGHT?

### L.E.R TEST

**Aim:** To determine if the WANT is fundamentally LEGITIMATE and permissible in principle.

| Letter | Name | Function | Focus Question |
|--------|------|----------|----------------|
| **L** | LEGAL | Rules Check | Is the WANT ALLOWED by laws, regulations, contracts, or formal agreements? |
| **E** | ETHICAL | Morality Check | Is the WANT MORALLY RIGHT? (fair, safe, respectful, not harmful) |
| **R** | REVERSIBLE | Mirror Check | Would I accept this WANT if applied TO ME? (Verifies L and E) |

### The Mirror Check (R): Why It Matters

The Reversible test — "Would I accept this if applied to me?" — is the ultimate gut-check. It catches self-serving rationalisations that slip through abstract ethical reasoning. People can justify almost anything in the abstract, but when forced to imagine the same treatment applied to themselves, hypocrisy becomes visible.

This test operationalises what philosophers call the Golden Rule — one of the oldest and most universal ethical principles in human history.

### The Golden Rule: Universal Foundation

The principle of treating others as one would wish to be treated appears independently across virtually all human cultures and traditions:

- **Confucius (551–479 BCE):** "Do not do to others what you do not want them to do to you."
- **Buddhism:** "Hurt not others in ways that you yourself would find hurtful."
- **Judaism (Hillel):** "What is hateful to you, do not do to your fellow."
- **Christianity (Matthew 7:12):** "Do to others what you would have them do to you."
- **Islam:** "None of you truly believes until he loves for his brother what he loves for himself."

This near-universal presence suggests the principle arises from basic human empathy and the requirements of social cooperation. The Mirror Check harnesses this ancient wisdom as a practical test.

---

## Test 2: WISE — Is this WISE?

### B.U.S TEST

**Aim:** To determine if the WANT produces GOOD OUTCOMES across impact, scale, and time.

| Letter | Name | Function | Focus Question |
|--------|------|----------|----------------|
| **B** | BENEFIT | Impact Check | Who gains? Who loses? Is there net positive impact? |
| **U** | UNIVERSAL | Scale Check | Would the positive effects still hold if everyone adopted this WANT? |
| **S** | SUSTAINABLE | Duration Check | Do the positive effects last over time? |

This test evaluates consequences. Something can be legally permitted and ethically defensible in principle, yet still be unwise — producing more harm than benefit, working only if others don't do it, or creating short-term gains that collapse over time.

---

## Test 3: DOABLE — Is this DOABLE?

### A.C.T TEST

**Aim:** To determine if the WANT is FEASIBLE and can actually be executed.

| Letter | Name | Function | Focus Question |
|--------|------|----------|----------------|
| **A** | ASSETS | Resources Check | Are the necessary resources available? (money, time, people, tools) |
| **C** | CAPABILITY | Execution Check | Can the steps actually be carried out? (skills, process, authority) |
| **T** | TIMELY | Timing Check | Is it achievable within the required timeframe and current constraints? |

This test is purely practical. It does not judge whether the WANT is right or wise — only whether it can actually happen given current resources, capabilities, and constraints.

---

## The Decision Rule: Hierarchy of Tests

> **CRITICAL RULE**
>
> Reject any WANT that fails L.E.R or B.U.S, even if A.C.T passes.
>
> Only among WANTs that pass the first two tests should you use A.C.T to choose or plan implementation.

This hierarchy is essential. Without it, people justify wrong actions because they are easy. The tests must be applied in order:

1. **L.E.R first** — Is it RIGHT in principle?
2. **B.U.S second** — Is it WISE in outcomes?
3. **A.C.T last** — Is it DOABLE in practice?

A WANT that fails L.E.R or B.U.S is rejected — full stop. The fact that it passes A.C.T ("we can get away with it") is irrelevant. A.C.T only matters for WANTs that have already passed the first two tests.

---

## Worked Example: Phone Conflict

Two parents in a custody dispute disagree about phone parental controls. Each has a WANT. Let's test them.

### Father's WANT: Separate Control

*"I will set parental controls independently during my parenting time, without consulting Mother."*

| Test | Result | Reasoning |
|------|--------|-----------|
| **L (Legal)** | ✗ Fails | Violates court order (Schedule G) requiring joint decision-making |
| **E (Ethical)** | ✗ Fails | Unfair to child (inconsistent rules) and mother (excluded from decision) |
| **R (Reversible)** | ✗ Fails | Would father accept mother unilaterally overriding his decisions? No. |
| **B.U.S** | ✗ Fails | Child loses (inconsistency), not sustainable, not universal |
| **A.C.T** | ✓ Passes | Already happening — easy to execute |

**Verdict:** EASY but WRONG. Fails L.E.R and B.U.S. The fact that it passes A.C.T is irrelevant.

---

### Mother's WANT: Shared Control

*"We will agree on consistent parental controls that apply in both homes."*

| Test | Result | Reasoning |
|------|--------|-----------|
| **L (Legal)** | ✓ Passes | Complies with court order requiring joint decision-making |
| **E (Ethical)** | ✓ Passes | Fair to child (consistency) and both parents (equal input) |
| **R (Reversible)** | ✓ Passes | Mother would accept shared decision-making applied to her? Yes. |
| **B.U.S** | ✓ Passes | Child benefits, sustainable over time, works if universalised |
| **A.C.T** | ⚠ Partial | Requires father's cooperation — implementation barrier |

**Verdict:** RIGHT but HARD. Passes L.E.R and B.U.S. The partial A.C.T result tells us what's needed for implementation — not whether the WANT should be chosen.

---

### What the Tests Reveal

| Father's Position | Mother's Position |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Easy but WRONG** | **Right but HARD** |

The decision becomes clear: **The WANT that passes L.E.R and B.U.S should be chosen. A.C.T tells you what's needed to IMPLEMENT it.**

---

## Stage 3 Output

At the end of Stage 3, you have:

- ✓ Each candidate WANT tested against L.E.R (Right)
- ✓ Each candidate WANT tested against B.U.S (Wise)
- ✓ Each candidate WANT tested against A.C.T (Doable)
- ✓ Clear verdict: which WANTs pass, which fail, and why
- ✓ Implementation barriers identified (from A.C.T results)

---

## The Link to Stage 4

Stage 3 tells you what OUGHT to be — which WANTs are right and wise.

But knowing what ought to be is not the same as choosing to do it.

Stage 4 (Decision) takes the evaluated WANTs and asks: Given what is right and wise, what will you actually commit to doing? This is where judgment becomes intention.

## Working Template: Stage 3 Grid

Use this grid to evaluate each candidate WANT from Stage 2:

| WANT | L.E.R | B.U.S | A.C.T | Verdict |
|------|-------|-------|-------|---------|
| Party A's WANT | ✓ / ✗ / ⚠ | ✓ / ✗ / ⚠ | ✓ / ✗ / ⚠ | Pass / Fail / Notes |
| Party B's WANT | ✓ / ✗ / ⚠ | ✓ / ✗ / ⚠ | ✓ / ✗ / ⚠ | Pass / Fail / Notes |

**Remember:** A WANT must pass L.E.R AND B.U.S to be considered. A.C.T only determines implementation, not selection.

---

DECISION answers: Of what is possible, what do we choose to do?
DECISION is about resolving the conflict. How do we address the original conflict that we mapped in Stage 1?

## The Three Tests: Philosophical Foundation

The three tests are not arbitrary. They represent the three major traditions of ethical reasoning, ensuring comprehensive evaluation from multiple angles:

| Test | Philosophical Tradition | Domain | Core Question |
|------|------------------------|--------|---------------|
| **L.E.R** | Deontological (Kant, rules) | Permissibility in principle | Is it RIGHT? |
| **B.U.S** | Consequentialist (utility) | Prudence and effects | Is it WISE? |
| **A.C.T** | Pragmatic (feasibility) | Practical execution | Is it DOABLE? |

Together, these tests prevent common decision pitfalls: doing something legal but unwise, wise but impossible, or possible but wrong.

## Overview: The Three Tests

| Test | Name | Acronym | Question | Finds what's wrong with |
|------|------|---------|----------|------------------------|
| **1** | RIGHT | L.E.R | Is this RIGHT? | The PRINCIPLE |
| **2** | WISE | B.U.S | Is this WISE? | The OUTCOME |
| **3** | DOABLE | A.C.T | Is this DOABLE? | The EXECUTION |

---

## Test 1: RIGHT — Is this RIGHT?

### L.E.R TEST

**Aim:** To determine if the WANT is fundamentally LEGITIMATE and permissible in principle.

| Letter | Name | Function | Focus Question |
|--------|------|----------|----------------|
| **L** | LEGAL | Rules Check | Is the WANT ALLOWED by laws, regulations, contracts, or formal agreements? |
| **E** | ETHICAL | Morality Check | Is the WANT MORALLY RIGHT? (fair, safe, respectful, not harmful) |
| **R** | REVERSIBLE | Mirror Check | Would I accept this WANT if applied TO ME? (Verifies L and E) |

### The Mirror Check (R): Why It Matters

The Reversible test — "Would I accept this if applied to me?" — is the ultimate gut-check. It catches self-serving rationalisations that slip through abstract ethical reasoning. People can justify almost anything in the abstract, but when forced to imagine the same treatment applied to themselves, hypocrisy becomes visible.

This test operationalises what philosophers call the Golden Rule — one of the oldest and most universal ethical principles in human history.

### The Golden Rule: Universal Foundation

The principle of treating others as one would wish to be treated appears independently across virtually all human cultures and traditions:

- **Confucius (551–479 BCE):** "Do not do to others what you do not want them to do to you."
- **Buddhism:** "Hurt not others in ways that you yourself would find hurtful."
- **Judaism (Hillel):** "What is hateful to you, do not do to your fellow."
- **Christianity (Matthew 7:12):** "Do to others what you would have them do to you."
- **Islam:** "None of you truly believes until he loves for his brother what he loves for himself."

This near-universal presence suggests the principle arises from basic human empathy and the requirements of social cooperation. The Mirror Check harnesses this ancient wisdom as a practical test.

---

## Test 2: WISE — Is this WISE?

### B.U.S TEST

**Aim:** To determine if the WANT produces GOOD OUTCOMES across impact, scale, and time.

| Letter | Name | Function | Focus Question |
|--------|------|----------|----------------|
| **B** | BENEFIT | Impact Check | Who gains? Who loses? Is there net positive impact? |
| **U** | UNIVERSAL | Scale Check | Would the positive effects still hold if everyone adopted this WANT? |
| **S** | SUSTAINABLE | Duration Check | Do the positive effects last over time? |

This test evaluates consequences. Something can be legally permitted and ethically defensible in principle, yet still be unwise — producing more harm than benefit, working only if others don't do it, or creating short-term gains that collapse over time.

---

## Test 3: DOABLE — Is this DOABLE?

### A.C.T TEST

**Aim:** To determine if the WANT is FEASIBLE and can actually be executed.

| Letter | Name | Function | Focus Question |
|--------|------|----------|----------------|
| **A** | ASSETS | Resources Check | Are the necessary resources available? (money, time, people, tools) |
| **C** | CAPABILITY | Execution Check | Can the steps actually be carried out? (skills, process, authority) |
| **T** | TIMELY | Timing Check | Is it achievable within the required timeframe and current constraints? |

This test is purely practical. It does not judge whether the WANT is right or wise — only whether it can actually happen given current resources, capabilities, and constraints.

---

## The Decision Rule: Hierarchy of Tests

> **CRITICAL RULE**
>
> Reject any WANT that fails L.E.R or B.U.S, even if A.C.T passes.
>
> Only among WANTs that pass the first two tests should you use A.C.T to choose or plan implementation.

This hierarchy is essential. Without it, people justify wrong actions because they are easy. The tests must be applied in order:

1. **L.E.R first** — Is it RIGHT in principle?
2. **B.U.S second** — Is it WISE in outcomes?
3. **A.C.T last** — Is it DOABLE in practice?

A WANT that fails L.E.R or B.U.S is rejected — full stop. The fact that it passes A.C.T ("we can get away with it") is irrelevant. A.C.T only matters for WANTs that have already passed the first two tests.

## Worked Example: Phone Conflict

Two parents in a custody dispute disagree about phone parental controls. Each has a WANT. Let's test them.

### Father's WANT: Separate Control

*"I will set parental controls independently during my parenting time, without consulting Mother."*

| Test | Result | Reasoning |
|------|--------|-----------|
| **L (Legal)** | ✗ Fails | Violates court order (Schedule G) requiring joint decision-making |
| **E (Ethical)** | ✗ Fails | Unfair to child (inconsistent rules) and mother (excluded from decision) |
| **R (Reversible)** | ✗ Fails | Would father accept mother unilaterally overriding his decisions? No. |
| **B.U.S** | ✗ Fails | Child loses (inconsistency), not sustainable, not universal |
| **A.C.T** | ✓ Passes | Already happening — easy to execute |

**Verdict:** EASY but WRONG. Fails L.E.R and B.U.S. The fact that it passes A.C.T is irrelevant.

---

### Mother's WANT: Shared Control

*"We will agree on consistent parental controls that apply in both homes."*

| Test | Result | Reasoning |
|------|--------|-----------|
| **L (Legal)** | ✓ Passes | Complies with court order requiring joint decision-making |
| **E (Ethical)** | ✓ Passes | Fair to child (consistency) and both parents (equal input) |
| **R (Reversible)** | ✓ Passes | Mother would accept shared decision-making applied to her? Yes. |
| **B.U.S** | ✓ Passes | Child benefits, sustainable over time, works if universalised |
| **A.C.T** | ⚠ Partial | Requires father's cooperation — implementation barrier |

**Verdict:** RIGHT but HARD. Passes L.E.R and B.U.S. The partial A.C.T result tells us what's needed for implementation — not whether the WANT should be chosen.

---

### What the Tests Reveal

| Father's Position | Mother's Position |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Easy but WRONG** | **Right but HARD** |

The decision becomes clear: **The WANT that passes L.E.R and B.U.S should be chosen. A.C.T tells you what's needed to IMPLEMENT it.**

---

## Stage 3 Output

At the end of Stage 3, you have:

- ✓ Each candidate WANT tested against L.E.R (Right)
- ✓ Each candidate WANT tested against B.U.S (Wise)
- ✓ Each candidate WANT tested against A.C.T (Doable)
- ✓ Clear verdict: which WANTs pass, which fail, and why
- ✓ Implementation barriers identified (from A.C.T results)

---

## The Link to Stage 4

Stage 3 tells you what OUGHT to be — which WANTs are right and wise.

But knowing what ought to be is not the same as choosing to do it.

Stage 4 (Decision) takes the evaluated WANTs and asks: Given what is right and wise, what will you actually commit to doing? This is where judgment becomes intention.

But knowing what went wrong is not the same as knowing how to fix it.
Stage 4 (Decision) asks: Given what went wrong and who is accountable, how do we resolve the conflict we mapped in Stage 1?
JUDGMENT is backward-looking (what happened). DECISION is forward-looking (what to do).
## 2.8 Why You Play All Roles

No one else will — and no one else can.

In real conflicts, the five stages are almost always split across different people. Each does their fragment, but no single person is responsible for genuine resolution. No one is truly invested in ending the conflict — only in discharging their assigned role.

In a courtroom, for example:

- The judge JUDGES — but only based on what's presented
- The lawyers CHECK — but biased toward winning for their client
- The parties DECIDE — but only between the narrow options the system allows, and usually from exhaustion rather than clarity
- Enforcement ACTS — mechanically, carrying out orders rather than resolving anything
- And crucially, no one MAPS — no one names the full system: the hidden stakeholders, the structural forces, the unspoken patterns everyone pretends aren't there

Because the work is fragmented — and no one owns the whole — the root cause survives. You might "win," yet still feel hollow. The same fight returns in a new form. Or you lose and never understand why, leaving you powerless to prevent the next round.

This framework doesn't ask you to replace the judge, the lawyers, or the system. It asks you to do the full cycle yourself — in parallel — so you see what they miss, anticipate any outcome, and know exactly what to do next no matter what they decide.

When you hold the whole map in your own hands, you become the one person in the room who isn't surprised, isn't trapped, and sees clearly — whether you win, lose, or walk away.

And the most important part: You don't end up where you started. Each cycle, you evolve. The conflict changes. Your understanding deepens. Or the problem actually ends.
