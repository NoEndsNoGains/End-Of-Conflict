## The Reader Journey (Updated)

| Part | What reader gets | Reader question answered | The "Hook" |
|------|------------------|--------------------------|------------|
| **Overview** | The whole picture | "What is this?" | "I can see the exit." |
| **Framework** | The method | "How do I use it?" | "I am finally doing something right." |
| **Foundations** | The heritage | "Why these choices?" | "This isn't just a list; it's a lineage." |
| **Stress Testing** | The tests | "Does it actually work?" | "If it works for a war, it works for me." |
| **Deep Dive** | The original theory | "What's underneath?" | "I see the world differently now." |

## New Stress Tests Explained:

| Test | What it tests | The hard question |
|------|---------------|-------------------|
| **4.4 The Bad Actor** | Truth Tester, L.E.R filters | What if the other party is actively gaming the framework? |
| **4.5 The Asymmetry of Power** | Structural vs Operational distinction | What if a child fights a parent, or a citizen fights a state? |
| **4.6 The Irreversible Past** | The Gaps audit (Violated, Concealed, Ignored) | How do you apply Action when damage cannot be undone? |
