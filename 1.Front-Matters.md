## A Five-Stage Framework for Resolving the Unresolvable

Or Why we are like the betta fish

_Summary:_

A systematic framework that transforms intractable conflicts into solvable problems by separating what happened from what to do about it.

Most conflicts persist not because they're unsolvable, but because we skip the steps resolution requires: we don't name them clearly, we assume instead of verify, we judge people instead of consequences, we confuse the verdict with the sentence, and we talk without acting. This book offers a five-stage diagnostic framework—Map, Reality, Judgment, Decision, Action—that forces the precision conflicts demand but emotions prevent.

Simple. Straightforward. Practical. Picture- based. 

And yet, a framework that still manages to turn everything on its head. A book that goes on a deep dive of what is obvious and never talked about. 

We learn that underneath the five stages lies an engine room: a Truth Tester that reveals we can only resolve what we capture—but what we capture is always imperfect, unwhole, and surrounded by the shaped silence of what wasn't; a Living Research Protocol that breaks every claim on purpose, because transformation happens through breaking ("I thought X, actually Y")—making the framework and each of its claims not only unfinished but continuously changing; and an Immunity Paradox that reveals why we fail at three levels—mapping symptoms instead of triggers, responding with blunt instruments, and forgetting everything the moment the ceasefire is signed.

The framework doesn't promise magic. It promises the best of what's possible—and shows you exactly where that boundary lies.


_Foreword_

**Foreword: Beautiful, Dramatic, Tragic**

We, you, I—aren't we beautiful, dramatic, and tragic all at once?

A bit like the betta fish.

Stunning creature. Iridescent. Fins like silk. Put a mirror in the tank and it attacks. Flares and exhausts itself against an enemy that isn't there. It's fighting a projection. Not reality.

It can do this until it dies.

In conflict, we're betta fish. Fighting our own reflection. Exhausting ourselves against glass.

This book won't make you peaceful. Some conflicts are real. Some enemies aren't reflections.

But most of the time? We're attacking the mirror.

This framework is how you check.
