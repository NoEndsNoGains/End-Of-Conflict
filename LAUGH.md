Sometimes the only thing left it to laugh. 
I can't do it otherwise.

This book obviously failed if I did not acomplishe even that. 

A list of places where you should be laughting (and where maybe you did not) - if you didn't: what's wrong with your sense of homour??

**Sun Tzu:**

> “Know yourself, know your enemy, a hundred battles, a hundred victories” → *“Map yourself, check your enemy, judge what’s hidden, decide what remains, act — one conflict, actually ended.”*

**Hamlet:**

> “To be or not to be” → *“To map or not to map — that is not the question. The question is what you’re hiding.”*

**Descartes:**

> “I think therefore I am” → *“I say, I do, I want, I hide, I miss — therefore I am in conflict.”*

**Nietzsche:**

> “He who fights monsters should see to it that he does not become a monster. And if you gaze long into the abyss, the abyss gazes back” → *“He who fights reflections should see to it that he is not the dog. And if you gaze long into the conflict, check whether it gazes back — or just mirrors.”*

**Rumi:**

> “Out beyond ideas of wrongdoing and rightdoing, there is a field. I’ll meet you there.” → *“Out beyond Violated and Concealed and Ignored, there is a decision. I’ll meet you there — if you’ve mapped the field first.”*

**Sherlock Holmes:**

> “When you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth” → *“When Bloodhound eliminates what they say from what they do, whatever remains — however uncomfortable — is what they want.”*

**Ecclesiastes:**

> “There is nothing new under the sun” → *“Same fight, different day? There is nothing new — you haven’t mapped it.”*

**Marcus Aurelius:**

> “You have power over your mind, not outside events” → *“You have power over micro-agency — your perception, your reactions, your story. Macro-responsibility belongs elsewhere.”*

**Lao Tzu:**

> “The journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step” → *“The end of conflict begins with Eagle. You cannot check what you haven’t mapped.”*

**Shakespeare (Macbeth):**

> “Fair is foul and foul is fair” → *“What they say is not what they do. What they do is not what they want. Bloodhound knows.”*

**The Bible:**

> “The truth shall set you free” → *“The truth shall set you free — but first, Bloodhound must sniff it out, and Owl must judge what it cost.”*

**Hemingway:**

> “Write drunk, edit sober” → *“Fight blind, map sober.”*

**Maya Angelou:**

> “When someone shows you who they are, believe them the first time” → *“When Bloodhound shows you what they do versus what they say — that’s who they are. No exception.”*

**Kafka:**

> “A cage went in search of a bird” → *“A verdict went in search of a decision. It starved. Judgment is not solution.”*

**My favourite for the transition from prologue to cheat sheet:**

**Dante:**

> “In the middle of the journey of our life, I found myself in a dark wood, for the straight way was lost” → *“In the middle of the conflict, I found myself in noise — for I had not mapped. The slapping showed me the door. The tables are the path.”*

**Caesar twist:**

> “Veni, vidi, vici” → *“I slapped, I mapped, I tabled.”*

**Churchill:**

> “This is not the end. It is not even the beginning of the end. But it is, perhaps, the end of the slapping.”

**Dante at the gates of Hell:**

> “Abandon all bullshit, ye who enter here.”

**The Godfather:**

> “I’m gonna make you a table you can’t escape.”

**Princess Bride:**

> “Hello. My name is Eagle. You hid the truth. Prepare to be mapped.”

**Fight Club:**

> “The first rule of End-Of-Conflict: you map the fucking conflict.”

**Socrates:**

> “The unmapped conflict is not worth having.”

**Or original, in your voice:**

> “The slapping will continue until the mapping improves.”
