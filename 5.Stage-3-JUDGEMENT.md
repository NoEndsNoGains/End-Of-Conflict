STEP 2: TEST                                
Action: Test the WANT  |  Focus: Where is the problem?  |  Goal: Find what's WRONG — in principle, outcome, or execution

L.E.R TEST                                
Aim: To determine if the WANT is fundamentally LEGITIMATE and permissible in principle.                                
                                
        Letter        Name        Function        Focus Question
L        L        LEGAL        Rules Check        Is the WANT ALLOWED by laws, regulations, contracts, or formal agreements?
E        E        ETHICAL        Morality Check        Is the WANT MORALLY RIGHT? (fair, safe, respectful, not harmful)
R        R        REVERSIBLE        Mirror Check        Would I accept this WANT if applied TO ME? (Verifies L and E)
                                
                                
Test 2: WISE — Is this WISE?                                
B.U.S TEST                                
Aim: To determine if the WANT produces GOOD OUTCOMES across impact, scale, and time.                                
                                
        Letter        Name        Function        Focus Question
B        B        BENEFIT        Impact Check        Who gains? Who loses? Is there net positive impact?
U        U        UNIVERSAL        Scale Check        Would the positive effects still hold if everyone adopted this WANT?
S        S        SUSTAINABLE        Duration Check        Do the positive effects last over time?
                                
                                
Test 3: DOABLE — Is this DOABLE?                                
A.C.T TEST                                
Aim: To determine if the WANT is FEASIBLE and can actually be executed.                                
                                
        Letter        Name        Function        Focus Question
A        A        ASSETS        Resources Check        Are the necessary resources available? (money, time, people, tools)
C        C        CAPABILITY        Execution Check        Can the steps actually be carried out? (skills, process, authority)
T        T        TIMELY        Timing Check        Is it achievable within the required timeframe and current constraints?
