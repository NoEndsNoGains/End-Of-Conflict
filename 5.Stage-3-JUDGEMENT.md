# Stage 3: JUDGMENT

*Evaluate what ought to be done*

JUDGMENT isn't just "what were the consequences" — it's specifically evaluating where truth was violated. What was lied about. What was hidden. It's identifying the gap between truth and what was presented or suppressed. That's more precise than accountability in general — it's accountability for truth failures.

JUDGMENT answers: Given the truth and its violations, what is possible to decide?

What belongs in JUDGMENT:
The evaluation of what went wrong — identifying truth violations, failures, and unmet needs:

What was lied about? What was hidden?
Was there deception, concealment, neglect, mistakes, or miscommunication?
What needs were unmet, ignored, or misunderstood?
Who bears responsibility, and for what?
What must be addressed or accounted for?

This is backward-looking. It evaluates the truth established in Stage 2.

| **Output** | Evaluated WANTs — which pass, which fail, and why |

## What This Stage Is

Stage 2 (Truth) established what is actually happening and inferred the candidate WANTs — what each party is really trying to achieve. But knowing what someone wants is not the same as knowing whether they should get it.

Stage 3 evaluates each WANT against three tests. These tests cover the three fundamental questions any proposed course of action must answer: Is it RIGHT? Is it WISE? Is it DOABLE?

This stage is evaluative, not descriptive. You are no longer asking "what is true?" — you are asking "what ought to be?"
