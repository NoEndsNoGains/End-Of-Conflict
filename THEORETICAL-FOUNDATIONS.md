PART 3: THEORETICAL FOUNDATIONS


DO NOT READ - NEEDS RE-THINKING/EDITING


3.1 The Foundations of MAP (what traditions inform boundary-setting, conflict mapping)
3.2 The Foundations of REALITY (epistemology, truth-testing, evidence)
3.3 The Foundations of JUDGMENT (ethics, L.E.R / B.U.S / A.C.T, the three consequences)
3.4 The Foundations of DECISION (decision theory, the Mirror Check, Golden Rule)
3.5 The Foundations of ACTION (implementation, change theory, power)

ACT
Thinking about what A.C.T pushes against:
Achievable contrasts with:

Utopian / idealistic approaches (perfect solutions that can't be implemented)
Maximalist positions (demanding everything, achieving nothing)
Perfectionism (waiting for the flawless option)

Clear contrasts with:

Aspirational frameworks (nice values, vague actions)
"Agree to disagree" non-resolutions (feels resolved, isn't)
Ambiguous settlements (words that mean different things to each party)

Timely contrasts with:

Proceduralism (correct process, endless duration)
"Justice delayed" systems (technically fair, practically useless)
Open-ended negotiation (no forcing function)


Possible framings:

Not purely idealistic (A.C.T demands achievability)
Not purely aspirational (A.C.T requires clarity)
Not purely procedural (A.C.T insists on timeliness)
