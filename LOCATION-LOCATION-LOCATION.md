*Before you map the conflict, you map your position relative to it.*

**MAIN QUESTION: WHO ARE YOU IN POSTION TO THIS CONFLICT?**

---

### Why This Matters?

Immagine this scenario: 



Your position determines what you see — and what you literally cannot see.

The Mother: Sees danger circling her children. Blind spot: how her vigilance lands on them — the grip that bruises what it's trying to hold.
The Father: Sees a life that was promised slipping away. Blind spot: what he calls "normal" might be a cage for someone else.
The Judge: Sees two competing claims, two sets of allegations. Blind spot: the body behind the bench has preferences, histories, flinches — and they're ruling too.
The Child: Sees two people they love who can't be in the same room. Blind spot: the machine. The lawyers, the schedules, the orders — the whole apparatus they're being fed through.

~

### The Hardest Step

This is the hardest and most important step in the entire framework.

Not because it's complicated — it isn't. But because it asks you to admit: **I am a Party with something to protect.**

Everything else only works after that.

HIDDEN QUESTION: WHAT DO I PROTECT? WHAT IS I AM MOST AFFRAID?

The motther: I am looosing my children.
The father:
The judge: They saw my biased decsions. My career is over if this is made public.
The child: What is going on??

### 0A. What Is My Position?

This is a full arc. The machine builds itself, then points at the wreckage and says "see?"

---

### 0A. What Is My Position?

**Imagine the first one:**

So what is your position? Are you just watching? A passer-by? Or more like a witness statement writer?

Imagine a father who collects 13 witness statements about the mother of his children. They all confirm one thing: SHE IS EVIL. All written with just a different style and variation of adjectives.

*"She was the kindest thing possible but who starts a PhD after giving birth?"*

*"Women should be put on a short lead. Study? What? Just after giving birth?"*

*"Yes, I was living with them. At the start it was fine but later... She is controlling. Obsessive. Was there something going on between me and the father? What? What do you mean? I just know she is a horrible mother. No, we did not sleep with each other. I was helping him. She was working all the time."*

*"What, her studying is supposed to be excused because of what? For God's sake! She is a mother now! Like, can people learn what their priorities are!"*

All full of stories and proof. 13 whole plumed proofs you are Evil.

Are these people observers or parties?

Even if they were wrong, the 13 created the future — they made it the future.

---

**Imagine the second one:**

There are 13 witness statements in front of me. I did not ask for statements yet. They are all signed and written before the proceedings even started.

Why? Is everything pre-planned here?

Who cares. It can't be that 13 people are so mistaken. Something must be wrong with her. I can't accept them — that would be against the law... but I wonder how deep that wrong goes?

*Hello, Mr X, how deeply "a kuku" are you?*

No, I can't say that. I am the judge. Let me just think it and then pray, pray, pray to God I don't slip up with what I really think.

Shit. I slipped.

---

**Imagine the third one:**

Shit. Judge didn't allow the witness statements. I can't believe the idea I gave you didn't work out.

Honey, how do we catch her? We must catch her somehow.

I know! I know! What about you watch her with a camera whenever you come to pick the children up? Like, that way you're scared, you know, that she's that abuser for real? You can get a camera for yourself for Christmas? Or I can put it on our wedding list?

Now, I can't be a witness. This would trace too much to me. Let me work it all out — we just use my voice but as if you are speaking.

---

**Imagine the fourth one:**

In front of me is the mother. Three months into court proceedings, she bit her younger child. It seems the accusations against her are real. I agree to remove the children from her care. They won't be living with her.

Father was right all along.

The truth and justice always prevail.

---

**What the four scenes show:**

The witnesses weren't observing. They were building.
The judge wasn't neutral. He was leaning.
The new partner wasn't supporting. She was directing.
And when the mother finally broke — *that* became the proof.

The machine made the collapse. Then pointed at it.

---
The Framework Scales
You might think: this is just family court drama. Small stakes. Private pain.
But the machinery is the same at every level.

Imagine the fifth one: Two Piles of Testimony
In Israel, the Shoah Foundation collects over 400 video testimonies from October 7 survivors. A mother describes the last text from her son before he was taken. A man describes hiding for 27 hours while his neighbours were murdered. A woman describes what happened at the music festival. They are archived. Indexed. Preserved against denial.
In Gaza, B'Tselem researchers interview survivors. A mother describes her three-year-old daughter killed when the building she was hiding in was hit. A man describes being stripped, blindfolded, made to crawl. A nurse describes amputations without anaesthesia. They are archived. Indexed. Preserved against erasure.
Two archives. Two truths. Both real.
And here's the question: When you choose which archive to believe — which testimony to share, which suffering to name — are you an observer?
Or are you laying bricks?

Imagine the sixth one: The Neutral Journalist
She works at a major Western network. She reports "what both sides say." She is careful. Professional.
But here's what the research shows: When Israelis are killed, the headline uses active voice. "Hamas kills 1,200." When Palestinians are killed, the headline goes passive. "40,000 have died." Died how? Of what? The sentence doesn't say. The grammar erases the hand.
She doesn't notice. She's just using the house style. She's just following the template her editors gave her.
The template was a brick. She laid it.

Imagine the seventh one: The Child of October 7 / The Child of Gaza
One child saw their parent murdered by militants who came through the fence.
One child saw their parent crushed when the building collapsed.
Both children will grow up inside a structure they didn't build. Both will be told which grief counts. Both will learn, before they can name it, that the world has already chosen sides.
The observer says: "It's complicated."
The framework says: There is no observer. There is only the question — whose bricks are you carrying?

Does this land as an interlude? I kept it brutal but balanced — the point isn't to take a side, it's to show that taking a side is what makes you a party, and that the machinery of conflict-building operates identically whether it's 13 witness statements in family court or thousands of archived testimonies in a geopolitical war.
Want me to integrate this into the full section, or adjust the tone?


| Position | Definition |
|----------|------------|
| **Observer** | No power, no output, no stake. Purely private learning. *(Extremely rare.)* |
| **Party — Direct** | You are IN the conflict: disputant, victim, aggressor, decision-maker, the child, the court. |
| **Party — Indirect** | You are CONNECTED to the conflict but not inside it: advisor, witness, commentator, affected bystander. |

**The Reality Check:** If you are reading this to "win" or "to be right," you are a Party.

**Your role shapes your blind spot:**

| If you are... | You likely see... | Your blind spot... |
|---------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| A disputant (mother, father) | Threats to yourself or your children | Your own reactivity, your own contribution |
| A decision-maker (judge, court) | Two competing claims | Your own internal biases |
| The affected (child, grandparent) | Two people who can't be in a room | The legal/structural machine shaping your life |

**My position:** _______________________________________

**My role within that position:** _______________________________________
---

### 0B. What Am I Protecting?

What you protect is what you will refuse to map.

**Why this question is hard:**

What you're protecting won't FEEL like protection. It will feel like truth. It will feel like survival.

"I'm not protecting anything. I'm just trying to protect my kids from harm."

That's what protection sounds like from the inside. The framework asks you to name it anyway — not because your concern isn't real, but because unnamed protection becomes a blind spot.

---

Are you protecting:
- Your reputation?
- Your job or career?
- Your "Good Parent" badge?
- A secret shame?
- Something you did that harmed someone?

**If you don't name what you're protecting, the Eagle will fly with one eye closed.**

**What do I protect?**

_______________________________________

**What am I most likely to miss from this position?**

### 0C. When Are You Looking At This Conflict?

You are always looking FROM now. But the conflict itself may be in a different time.

| Time | Definition | Why It Matters |
|------|------------|----------------|
| **Past** | Already happened. You know how it ended. | Sense-making, release, justice, or prevention. |
| **Present** | Happening now. | You can see, judge, decide, and act. |
| **Future** | Has not played out yet. | Your map is hypothesis. Simulation, not resolution. |

**The conflict I am mapping is:** ☐ Past  ☐ Present  ☐ Future

---

### Note: Position Can Shift

You locate yourself once at the start. But the act of mapping can change your position.

The moment you use this framework to gain sight, you are no longer passive — you have become an Agent. If your position shifts during the process, note it.

**The map changes when the mapper changes.**

---

### Note: The Map Reflects the Map-Maker

Different parties will draw different maps of the same conflict. This is not a bug — it's data.

Your map is YOUR map. It reflects what you can see from where you stand. Later stages will test it against what others see.

---

*Now Eagle can fly.*


---

### Check Yourself

You just read "Locate Yourself." Your current state is:

- a) "Oh shit. I'm a Party. I have something to lose."
- b) "I'm definitely an Observer. This isn't about me."
- c) "I don't need to answer 'what am I protecting.' I'm not protecting anything."
- d) "This is a lot of forms. Can we just get to the part where I'm right?"

**The Verdict:** 
- If you picked (a): Good. You're ready. Eagle can fly.
- If you picked (b), (c), or (d): You're in the Fog. Go back to 0B. Name what you're protecting. Then try again.
