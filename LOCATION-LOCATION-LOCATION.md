*This chapter prepares you for the End of Conflict EBOLA framework — five stages named after animals: Eagle (map), Bloodhound (check), Owl (judge), Lion (decide), Ant (act).*

*Before you map the conflict, you map your position relative to it.*

---

## Why This Matters

Your position determines what you see — and what you literally cannot see.

**The Mother:** Sees danger circling her children. Blind spot: how her vigilance lands on them — the grip that bruises what it's trying to hold.

**The Father:** Sees a life that was promised slipping away. Blind spot: what he calls "normal" might be a cage for someone else.

**The Judge:** Sees two competing claims, two sets of allegations. Blind spot: the body behind the bench has preferences, histories, flinches — and they're ruling too.

**The Child:** Sees two people they love who can't be in the same room. Blind spot: the machine. The lawyers, the schedules, the orders — the whole apparatus they're being fed through.

---

## The Hardest Step

This is the hardest and most important step in the entire framework.

Not because it's complicated — it isn't. But because it asks you to admit: **I am a Party with something to protect.**

Everything else only works after that.

---

## The Six Coordinates

Think of these as the GPS points that tell you exactly where you are standing before Eagle can fly.

| Coordinate | The Question | What It Captures |
|------------|--------------|------------------|
| **1. POSITION** | What is my role? | Mother / Father / Judge / Child / Witness / "Observer." Party Direct or Indirect. |
| **2. WANT** | What outcome am I building toward? | What does "winning" look like to me? |
| **3. FEAR** | What am I afraid of losing? | The terror driving my actions. |
| **4. GAME** | What am I hiding from OTHERS? | My strategy. Deliberate concealment. |
| **5. BLIND SPOT** | What am I hiding from MYSELF? | Self-deception. The story I tell myself. |
| **6. HORIZON** | What CAN'T I see from this position? | Structural impossibility. Not unwillingness — incapacity. |

Plus:

| **7. TIME** | When is this conflict? | Past / Present / Future. |

---

## Seven Windows Into the Same Machine

Each scenario illuminates one coordinate. By the end, you'll see: every person was asked to look. Most couldn't.

---

### GROUP A: THE MACHINE
#### *(How we are used)*

---

**Imagine the first one: The 13 Witnesses**

*Coordinate: POSITION*

A father collects 13 witness statements about the mother of his children. They all confirm one thing: SHE IS EVIL. All written with just a different style and variation of adjectives.

*"She was the kindest thing possible but who starts a PhD after giving birth?"*

*"Women should be put on a short lead. Study? What? Just after giving birth?"*

*"Yes, I was living with them. At the start it was fine but later... She is controlling. Obsessive. Was there something going on between me and the father? What? What do you mean? I just know she is a horrible mother. No, we did not sleep with each other. I was helping him. She was working all the time."*

*"What, her studying is supposed to be excused because of what? For God's sake! She is a mother now! Like, can people learn what their priorities are!"*

All full of stories and proof. 13 whole plumed proofs you are Evil.

Even if they were wrong, the 13 created the future — they made it the future.

> **The Coordinate Question:**
> What is their POSITION? What do they THINK it is?
> 
> *(They think they're Observers. They're Parties. They're not watching — they're building.)*
> 
> **An Observer watches the weather. A Party builds the storm.**

---

**Imagine the second one: The Judge**

*Coordinate: BLIND SPOT*

There are 13 witness statements in front of me. I did not ask for statements yet. They are all signed and written before the proceedings even started.

Why? Is everything pre-planned here?

Who cares. It can't be that 13 people are so mistaken. Something must be wrong with her. I can't accept them — that would be against the law... but I wonder how deep that wrong goes?

*Hello, Mrs X, how deeply disturbed are you?*

No, I can't say that. I am the judge. Let me just think it and then pray, pray, pray to God I don't slip up with what I really think.

Shit. I slipped.

> **The Coordinate Question:**
> What is he hiding from HIMSELF?
> 
> *(He knows the bias is improper. He can't see that he's already been captured by it.)*

---

**Imagine the third one: The New Partner**

*Coordinate: GAME*

Shit. Judge didn't allow the witness statements. I can't believe the idea I gave you didn't work out.

Listen, we need some kind of evidence. I have good colleagues — not direct but we know each other. She can refer you to a domestic violence organisation. That should work. Just tell them how scared you are of her. Not physically — mentally. That she abuses you emotionally. How she treats you. Do you understand?

But we need to prove that you're somehow really scared. How could we do that?

I know. The camera.

No, it doesn't matter there's nothing on the video. She doesn't even show herself, not to mention say anything. The most important thing is that you record. Do you get it? It's your proof of how she makes you feel. That will be enough. Put it on our wedding gift list.

And no — you can't mention my name anywhere. I must be officially not in the game. Do you get me? No trace back to me.

Let me work it all out. I will make it work for us.

> **The Coordinate Question:**
> What is she hiding from OTHERS?
> 
> *(She's not supporting. She's directing. The invisibility is the strategy.)*

---

**Imagine the fourth one: The Verdict**

*Coordinate: THE MACHINE (all coordinates combine)*

The mother is in front of me. The witness statements were the signal. Now we have concrete proof. I agree — remove children from her care.

What, the younger one she bit — she's still breastfeeding him? Who cares.

She bit a child so hard there was a bruise.

What — 30 minutes after he dropped them off and recorded? What — the child was biting her? What — the 13 witness statements, none of them allowed as evidence?

Proof is proof. Guilty is guilty.

We are done here.

---

**What the four scenes show:**

The witnesses weren't observing. They were building.

The judge wasn't neutral. He was leaning.

The new partner wasn't supporting. She was directing.

And when the mother finally broke — *that* became the proof.

The machine made the collapse. Then pointed at it.

> **The System Question:**
> What can't ANY of them see?
> 
> *(The machine. The coordinated outcome none of them planned but all of them built.)*

---

### GROUP B: THE MIRROR
#### *(How we use ourselves)*

---

You might think: this is just family court drama. Small stakes. Private pain.

But the machinery is the same at every level.

---

**Imagine the fifth one: Two Piles of Testimony**

*Coordinate: WANT*

In Israel, the Shoah Foundation collects over 400 video testimonies from October 7 survivors. A mother describes the last text from her son before he was taken. A man describes hiding for 27 hours while his neighbours were murdered. A woman describes what happened at the music festival. They are archived. Indexed. Preserved against denial.

In Gaza, B'Tselem researchers interview survivors. A mother describes her three-year-old daughter killed when the building she was hiding in was hit. A man describes being stripped, blindfolded, made to crawl. A nurse describes amputations without anaesthesia. They are archived. Indexed. Preserved against erasure.

Two archives. Two truths. Both real.

> **The Coordinate Question:**
> Which archive do YOU reach for? Why?
> 
> When you choose which archive to believe — which testimony to share, which suffering to name — are you an observer?
> 
> Or are you laying bricks?
> 
> *(Your WANT shapes which truth you carry.)*

---

**Imagine the sixth one: The Neutral Journalist**

*Coordinate: HORIZON*

She works at a major Western network. She reports "what both sides say." She is careful. Professional.

But here's what the research shows: When Israelis are killed, the headline uses active voice. *"Hamas kills 1,200."* When Palestinians are killed, the headline goes passive. *"40,000 have died."* Died how? Of what? The sentence doesn't say. The grammar erases the hand.

She doesn't notice. She's just using the house style. She's just following the template her editors gave her.

The template was a brick. She laid it.

> **The Coordinate Question:**
> What template are YOU following without seeing?
> 
> *(Her HORIZON — what she can't see from where she stands — is the frame she inherited. She's not hiding it from herself. She genuinely can't see it.)*

---

**Imagine the seventh one: Two Children**

*Coordinate: POSITION (Inherited)*

One child saw their parent murdered by militants who came through the fence.

One child saw their parent crushed when the building collapsed.

Both children will grow up inside a structure they didn't build. Both will be told which grief counts. Both will learn, before they can name it, that the world has already chosen sides.

The observer says: *"It's complicated."*

The framework says: **There is no observer. There is only the question — whose bricks are you carrying?**

> **The Coordinate Question:**
> What structure did YOU inherit?
> 
> What conflict were you born into? What POSITION was assigned before you could choose?

---

## The Coordinates: Summary

| Coordinate | Scenario That Illuminates It | The Lesson |
|------------|------------------------------|------------|
| **POSITION** | The 13 Witnesses | They think they're watching. They're building. |
| **BLIND SPOT** | The Judge | He can't see his own bias. |
| **GAME** | The New Partner | She's hiding her orchestration. |
| **THE MACHINE** | The Verdict | All coordinates combine. The collapse was manufactured. |
| **WANT** | Two Archives | Which truth do you WANT? That's the one you'll carry. |
| **HORIZON** | The Journalist | The template you can't see because you're inside it. |
| **POSITION (Inherited)** | Two Children | You didn't choose the structure. But you're in it. |

---

## The Distinction: BLIND SPOT vs HORIZON

These are different:

| | BLIND SPOT | HORIZON |
|---|---|---|
| **What it is** | What I'm hiding from MYSELF | What I CAN'T see from this position |
| **Type** | Active self-deception | Structural impossibility |
| **Example** | The Judge knows bias is wrong but won't admit he has it | The Child literally cannot see the legal bills, the history, the adult strategies |
| **The question** | What do I not WANT to see? | What CAN'T I see from here? |

> **Note:** HORIZON here means YOUR structural limitation — what you can't see because of who you are. Eagle also maps "the horizon" of the conflict itself — what exists but hasn't been mapped yet. These are related: your Location Horizon predicts what Eagle will miss.

---

## Position Types

| Position | Definition |
|----------|------------|
| **Observer** | No power, no output, no stake. Purely private learning. *(Extremely rare.)* |
| **Party — Direct** | You are IN the conflict: disputant, victim, aggressor, decision-maker, the child, the court. |
| **Party — Indirect** | You are CONNECTED to the conflict but not inside it: advisor, witness, commentator, affected bystander. |

**The Reality Check:** If you are reading this to "win" or "to be right," you are a Party.

**If you are a Party, you WANT something.** Even wanting peace is a want. Even wanting it to end is a want. Name it.

**An Observer watches the weather. A Party builds the storm.**

---

## Your Role Shapes Your Coordinates

| If you are... | You likely WANT... | You likely FEAR... | Your BLIND SPOT... | Your HORIZON... |
|---------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------| ----------------|
| A disputant (mother, father) | Safety, recognition, vindication | Losing children, being erased | Your own contribution to the pattern | What happens in the other household |
| A decision-maker (judge, court) | Closure, correctness, efficiency | Being wrong, being exposed | Your own internal biases | The lives after you rule |
| The affected (child, grandparent) | Peace, for it to stop | Losing someone, being forced to choose | How you might be used | The legal/structural machine |
| A witness | To help, to be believed | Being wrong, being blamed | Why you're really testifying | The full picture you don't have |
| An "observer" | To understand, to be right | Being implicated | That you're a Party | That your "observation" is a brick |

---

## Time: When Is This Conflict?

You are always looking FROM now. But the conflict itself may be in a different time.

| Time | Definition | Why It Matters |
|------|------------|----------------|
| **Past** | Already happened. You know how it ended. | Sense-making, release, justice, or prevention. |
| **Present** | Happening now. | You can see, judge, decide, and act. |
| **Future** | Has not played out yet. | Your map is hypothesis. Simulation, not resolution. |

## Your Coordinate Card

Fill this in honestly. This is your pre-flight check.
```
MY COORDINATES:

1. POSITION: I am a _________________________________.
   ☐ Party (Direct)  ☐ Party (Indirect)  ☐ Observer (prove it)

2. WANT: I want _____________________________________.
   (What does "winning" look like to me?)

3. FEAR: I am afraid of losing _______________________.
   (What is the one thing I cannot let happen?)

4. GAME: What I'm not saying out loud is _____________.
   (What am I hiding from others? What's my strategy?)

5. BLIND SPOT: What I'm probably hiding from myself is
   __________________________________________________.
   (What do I not WANT to see?)

6. HORIZON: What I probably can't see from this position is
   __________________________________________________.
   (What is structurally invisible from where I stand?)

7. TIME: This conflict is:
   ☐ Past  ☐ Present  ☐ Future

SYSTEM CHECK:
What machine might I be part of that I cannot see?

## The Meta Question: Guess Their Coordinates

You have your coordinates. But you are not the only party.

**For each other party in the conflict, try to guess:**

| Party | Their WANT | Their FEAR | Their GAME | Their BLIND SPOT | Their HORIZON |
|-------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------------|--------------|
| ______ | | | | | |
| ______ | | | | | |
| ______ | | | | | |

If you can't fill this in — you haven't seen them. You've only seen your story about them.

**The Hardest Row:**

Now fill in what THEY would guess about YOU:

| YOU (from their view) | Their guess of your WANT | Their guess of your FEAR | Their guess of your GAME | Their guess of your BLIND SPOT |
|-----------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------------|
| | | | | |

This is what you look like from across the field.

---

## Note: Position Can Shift

You locate yourself once at the start. But the act of mapping can change your position.

The moment you use this framework to gain sight, you are no longer passive — you have become an Agent. If your position shifts during the process, note it.

**The map changes when the mapper changes.**

---

## Note: The Map Reflects the Map-Maker

Different parties will draw different maps of the same conflict. This is not a bug — it's data.

Your map is YOUR map. It reflects what you can see from where you stand. Later stages will test it against what others see.

---

## What Your Location Predicts

Your coordinates tell you why you will fail the Self-Checks.

When you run **Eagle:** Your WANT will tempt you to map only what serves your win.

When you run **Bloodhound:** Your FEAR will clog your nose with the preferred scent.

When you run **Owl:** Your BLIND SPOT will make your verdict comfortable instead of true.

When you run **Lion:** Your GAME will tempt you to decide what THEY must do, not what YOU will do.

When you run **Ant:** Your HORIZON will make you miss obstacles you couldn't see coming.

**The Self-Checks exist to catch your coordinates in the act.**

---

## Check Yourself

You just read "Location, Location, Location." Your current state is:

- a) "Oh shit. I'm a Party. I have coordinates. I have blind spots. I have a horizon."
- b) "I'm definitely an Observer. This isn't about me."
- c) "I don't need to fill in the Coordinate Card. I already know who I am."
- d) "This is a lot of forms. Can we just get to the part where I'm right?"

**The Verdict:**
- If you picked (a): Good. You're ready. Eagle can fly.
- If you picked (b), (c), or (d): You're in the Fog. Go back. Fill in your Coordinate Card. Then try again.

---

## The Handoff

Place your Coordinate Card on the table.

You are about to draw a map of the conflict. Your coordinates tell you which parts of the map you are likely to get wrong.

- Your **WANT** will pull the map toward your win.
- Your **FEAR** will erase what terrifies you.
- Your **GAME** will hide your own moves.
- Your **BLIND SPOT** will flatten what you don't want to see.
- Your **HORIZON** will cut off what you can't see from here.

Keep the card visible. When Eagle asks "Did I map the whole terrain?" — check your coordinates. That's where you cheated.

---

You have your coordinates. You know where you stand. You know what you want, what you fear, what you're hiding, what you can't see.

Your Location tells you WHY you will fail the Self-Checks.

The Self-Checks will catch you in the act.

Now Eagle can fly — with both eyes open.
