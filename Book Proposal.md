## BOOK PROPOSAL INFO (NOT COVERED ANYWHERE ELSE)

### Why now?

We are drowning in conflict we cannot resolve.
Families fracturing through courts that promise justice and deliver exhaustion. Institutions bleeding trust. Democracies splitting into tribes that no longer share facts. Conflicts where parties don't agree on what happened. Where information is weaponised. Where good faith is bad faith. Where shared facts are _mine vs yours_. Where systems meant to resolve disputes instead perpetuate them. Where a mutual desire to stop fighting is you being the only one caring about doing right — not being right.
That's a different game. A game that needs its own framework.
This book is that framework.

### What the book CAN do:

- **The 2am reader:** A framework to hold when everything feels chaotic.
- **The parent in court:** Language for what's happening. A tool to prepare, document, think.
- **The professional:** Something to give clients. A shared structure.
- **The one who gives up:** Permission to stop. Even "no hope" is a wall you built.
- **The academic:** A synthesis. Testable claims. An engine room to critique. A framework to put conflicts through.

### What This Book Cannot Do

- Make a bad actor cooperate
- Fix power imbalances
- Replace courts, therapy, or professional help
- Work without effort
- Promise resolution 

### Measurable Difference

**Before the framework:**
- Reacting emotionally to every provocation
- Confusing what happened with what to do about it
- Feeling stuck with no way forward
- Blaming people, not problems
- Exhausting yourself - fighting glass

**After the framework:**
- Pausing to map before responding
- Separating reality from decision
- Five stages to work through — progress visible on paper
- Naming what's Violated, Concealed, Ignored
- Knowing which conflicts are real, which are projection

---

### What Success Sounds Like

- **A parent:** "I finally understood what I was actually fighting about."
- **A mediator:** "I gave them the book. They came back with a map."
- **A therapist:** "The framework externalised the conflict. We could work with it."
- **An academic:** "The Immunity Paradox is testable. I'm designing a study."
- **A reader:** "I stopped. The Epilogue gave me permission."
  
## Tracking Impact

What's most important is that the framework is used. Tested. Broken.

What matters is real conflicts put through the framework and the results recorded.  Where it worked. Where it didn't. Where it broke completely. That's the valuable data I am interested in.

### What I'm not offering:

Empire.

I'll write it. I'll put it out. I'll invite people to break it.

But I'm not interested in building a business around this framework. If an institution, a research group, or a practitioner network wants to adopt it, test it, scale it — good. That's what it's for.

The framework is the contribution. Owning it was never the point.

### Connection to this book:

This book emerges from two sources:

**Academic expertise:**
Years of teaching organisational behaviour — how groups conflict, how systems fail, how institutions resist change. The framework draws on decision theory, ethics, epistemology, and conflict studies. The three tests (L.E.R, B.U.S, A.C.T) translate philosophical traditions into practical tools.

**Lived experience:**
I have been the person at 2am. I have navigated family court. I have been the betta fish, flaring at glass. This book is not written from above. It is written from inside.

The combination — academic rigour and personal stakes — is what makes this framework different. It is tested in theory and in life.

### Previously published works:

This is my first book.
I have published some academic work including but with limit so far focusing mainly on teaching. 

### Biography (short):

A Senior Lecturer in Organisational Behaviour at the University of the West of England. She holds a PhD and specialises in leadership, systemic change, institutional design, and organisational learning. Her research examines how systems fail — and how they might be fixed. 

This is her first book. It emerged from years of academic work and from navigating her own hopeless conflict.

She lives in Somerset, United Kingdom, with her family.

## Marketing plan

### What I bring:

| Asset | How it serves the book |
|-------|------------------------|
| University platform | Direct access to students studying organisational behaviour, conflict, change management |
| Academic networks | Connections to researchers, conferences, professional development programmes |
| Professional associations | Relationships with mediators, HR professionals, organisational consultants through teaching and research |
| The concept itself | "Betta fish" is memorable and shareable — designed to spread through word of mouth |

### What I would like to do:

- Change the book to an academic article as a co-laboration with other academics
- Present at academic and professional conferences
- Share with professional networks (mediators, family lawyers, HR)
- Make templates and resources available online to drive discovery
- Collect case studies and reader feedback to build evidence base

### What I won't pretend:

I am not a marketer. I don't have a social media following. I don't have an email list of 1 nor 50,000 subscribers.

I am an academic and a practitioner. I wrote this book because it needed to exist — for the person at 2am who has tried everything, i.e. me.

I am looking for a publisher who believes in the book itself, and who can bring the marketing expertise I don't have energy for. 

The hardest job will be to finish it. And the truth is I never finish anything. 

How is that for a book publication pitch?
