## Constraints: When to Use the End of Conflict Framework

**This framework applies when:**

1. **The conflict is external and observable** — something happening in the world that you can point to. Not internal feelings ("I feel torn") or abstract tensions ("incompatible worldviews"). There must be a visible fight.

2. **There are at least two parties** — identifiable actors who are in disagreement.

3. **The parties are capable of action** - they have agency — they are not forces of nature or abstract concepts)

4. **The conflict is about something specific** — it can be named. If you cannot say what they are fighting about, you do not yet have a conflict to analyse.

**This framework does NOT apply when:**

| Situation | Why not |
|-----------|---------|
| Internal conflict ("I feel torn between two choices") | No external parties — this is a personal dilemma, not a conflict |
| Abstract tension ("East vs West values") | Too vague — no identifiable parties, no specific fight |
| One party only ("I hate the weather") | No second party who could act differently |
| Forces beyond human control ("The river flooded") | No agency — cannot negotiate with nature |
| Pure misunderstanding with no dispute | If there is no disagreement once clarified, there is no conflict |

**One more constraint to consider adding?**

| "The map-maker has some knowledge of the conflict" | You cannot map what you know nothing about — you need at least surface-level information to begin |

A note on intention:
This framework reveals the structure of conflict — who is involved, what they want, what is true, and what is hidden.
That knowledge is power. And power can be used in different ways.
If your intention is resolution — to end the conflict in a way that is fair and sustainable — this framework will guide you there.
But if your intention is to win at any cost — to manipulate, to exploit what you learn, to use the truth as a weapon — this framework will serve that too. You will see the other party's weaknesses. You will know where to strike. You may win.
But you will know what you did.
The framework cannot protect you from that choice.
The choice is yours.
