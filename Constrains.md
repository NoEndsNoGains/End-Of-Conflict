# Constraints: When to Use the End of Conflict Framework

---

The End of Conflict framework can be applied to conflicts in the past, the present, or the future. It can be applied to external conflicts between parties, or to internal conflicts within yourself.

## The Five Stages

| Stage | Activity | Output |
|-------|----------|--------|
| **1: Map** | Name | Structure |
| **2: Truth** | See | Reality |
| **3: Judgment** | Judge | Ought |
| **4: Decision** | Choose | Intention |
| **5: Action** | Do | Change |

**The journey:**

$$\text{Map} \xrightarrow{\text{Courage}} \text{Truth} \xrightarrow{\text{Courage}} \text{Judgment} \xrightarrow{\text{Courage}} \text{Decision} \xrightarrow{\text{Courage}} \text{Action}$$

**Courage is the fuel.** It is the energy required to move from one stage to the next — to overcome the inertia of the status quo and the friction of self-deception and consequence. Without it, you stop.

| Stage | The Courage Required |
|-------|----------------------|
| **1: Map** | Courage to see — to include painful truths (yourself as a party, hidden beneficiaries) |
| **2: Truth** | Courage to know — to accept facts even if they invalidate your narrative |
| **3: Judgment** | Courage to evaluate — to apply standards equally, regardless of personal cost |
| **4: Decision** | Courage to commit — to choose the hard path (resolution) over the easy path (avoidance, winning) |
| **5: Action** | Courage to execute — to absorb the consequences (admitting fault, taking a loss) |


Stage,Activity (what you do),Output (what you get),Why it matters / What happens if you skip it
1: Map,Name the conflict precisely,A clear Structure (who is involved and exactly what they are fighting about),"Most people jump straight to opinions (“this side is evil”) without first defining the boundaries. Without a precise map, every later conclusion drifts or applies to the wrong problem. Stage 1 (which you called Stage 0 earlier) is the map: listing parties, their interests, the main conflict, and the specific sub-conflicts."
2: Truth,See what actually happened,"Objective Reality (facts, not claims)","People argue endlessly because each side has its own narrative. This stage zooms into each sub-conflict from the map and answers: What events occurred? What does each party claim? Where do claims diverge? Are divergences lies, mistakes, misunderstandings, or hidden facts? Only when you establish what is verifiably true can you move forward."
3: Judgment,Judge the facts against values or rules,"What ought to be (moral, legal, or practical evaluation)","Once you know what is true, you evaluate it. Is an action justified? Who bears responsibility? Was a rule violated? This stage produces clear normative conclusions (right/wrong, fair/unfair) grounded in the reality from Stage 2."
4: Decision,Choose a course of action,A specific Intention (what you or a party will do),"Knowing what ought to be isn’t enough — you must decide what you will actually commit to doing about it. This stage weighs options, costs, risks, and feasibility, then selects one path. It turns judgment into commitment."
5: Action,Do the chosen thing,Actual Change in the world,The only stage that affects reality. Everything before prepares for this. Most conflicts persist because people stop at talking (stages 1–3) without ever deciding and acting.

## Who uses this framework?

The framework is always used by an individual — one person, analysing a conflict from their position. **(See link to Living Research Protocol)**

But the conflict itself can be at different levels:







You're right. Let me think again:

---

**Internal conflict:**

| Hard because | Easy because |
|--------------|--------------|
| You are the analyst AND all the parties | You only have to do it once — on yourself |
| No distance — maximum blind spots | No double conflict — there is no separate "analysis conflict" |
| You cannot escape your own frame | You don't need to coordinate with anyone else |
| You may not want to see the truth about yourself | All the information is inside you (if you can access it) |

---

**External conflict:**

| Hard because | Easy because |
|--------------|--------------|
| The conflict is always double — original + analysis | You have some distance from the original conflict |
| You must see yourself AND the other parties | You can verify claims against external reality |
| You bring biases, stakes, frame — and may not know it | Other people can check your analysis |
| More parties = more complexity | |

---

**So the difficulty is not a simple hierarchy.**

It's more like:

| Level | What's hard | What's easier |
|-------|-------------|---------------|
| **Internal** | Seeing yourself. No distance. | Only one conflict. All information is within you. |
| **External** | Always double. You must analyse yourself AND the conflict. More complexity. | You have distance. External verification possible. |

---

**Maybe the framing should be:**

Internal = **hard to see**, easy to scope
External = **easier to see**, but always double — and the second conflict (yourself) is often invisible

---

Does this capture it better? Should I rewrite with this nuance?




**The funnel:**

```
External (Others)
       ↓
External (You involved)
       ↓
Internal (Within yourself)
```

The deeper you go, the more courage required. The more blind spots. The harder to see truth.

---

## This framework applies when:

1. **There are at least two positions** — identifiable stances that are in disagreement. In external conflicts, these are held by different parties. In internal conflicts, these are competing forces within yourself.

2. **The position-holder(s) have agency** — they are people, groups, or organisations capable of making choices. Not forces of nature, abstract concepts, or the past.

3. **The conflict can be named** — you can say what the fight is about. If you cannot name it, you do not yet have a conflict to analyse.

4. **You have some knowledge of the conflict** — you cannot map what you know nothing about. You need at least surface-level information to begin.

## Two dimensions of application

**Dimension 1: Level — Who is in conflict?**

| Level | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **External - Others** | Between other parties. You are observing. |
| **External - You involved** | Between you and others. You are a party. |
| **Internal** | Within yourself. Competing forces, externalised by naming them as positions. |

**Dimension 2: Time — When is the conflict?**

| Time | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Past** | Already happened. Memory, documents, evidence. You know how it ended. |
| **Present** | Happening now. Real events, real claims, real parties. |
| **Future** | Hasn't played out yet. Projections, assumptions, scenarios. You are preparing. |

---

## What each time mode allows:

| Time | Stage 1: Map | Stage 2: Truth | Stage 3: Judgment | Stage 4: Decision | Stage 5: Action |
|------|--------------|----------------|-------------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| **Past** | You can map | You can verify against evidence | You can judge with hindsight | Already decided | Already acted — you can learn |
| **Present** | You can map | You can verify against reality | You can judge | You can decide | You can act |
| **Future** | You can map | You are guessing — projections only | You are preparing | You are rehearsing | Not yet — simulation only |

**Note on Future mode:** Your map is a hypothesis. You are simulating, not resolving. Until the conflict plays out or you hear from the other party, your map is incomplete. Simulation is preparation, not resolution.

**Note on Internal conflicts:** These require the ability to step outside yourself and see your competing forces as if they were separate parties. This is the hardest application. You must also identify who else is affected — internal conflicts rarely stay internal.

## Internal conflict example: "Should I leave my job?"

| Party | Level | Type |
|-------|-------|------|
| Me (wants security) | Main | Benefits (from staying) |
| Me (wants freedom) | Main | Benefits (from leaving) |
| My family | Sub | Both |
| My employer | Sub | Loses (if I leave) |

This becomes a mappable conflict. Stage 2 (Truth) then asks: What is actually true? What is the real risk? What do my family actually want — not what I assume?

---

## This framework does NOT apply when:

| Situation | Why not |
|-----------|---------|
| Only one position ("I hate the weather") | No second position — you have frustration, not conflict |
| No agency ("The river flooded") | Cannot negotiate with nature |
| Cannot name the fight | If you cannot say what it's about, you cannot map it |
| You know nothing about it | You cannot map what you cannot see — gather information first |
| Pure misunderstanding with no dispute | If there is no disagreement once clarified, there is no conflict |

---

## A note on intention

This framework reveals the structure of conflict — who is involved, what they want, what is true, and what is hidden.

That knowledge is power. And power can be used in different ways.

If your intention is resolution — to end the conflict in a way that is fair and sustainable — this framework will guide you there.

But if your intention is to win at any cost — to manipulate, to exploit what you learn, to use the truth as a weapon — this framework will serve that too. You will see the other party's weaknesses. You will know where to strike. You may win.

But you will know what you did.

The framework cannot protect you from that choice.

**The choice is yours.**
