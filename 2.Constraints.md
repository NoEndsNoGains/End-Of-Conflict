# End of Conflict

A five-stage framework for analysing and resolving conflicts — external disputes or internal dilemmas.

---

## 1. Overview

### 1.1 What is this?

The End of Conflict Framework is a systematic process for resolving conflicts that seem intractable. It applies to disputes between people, groups, or institutions, and to internal dilemmas within one person (modelled as competing "parties"). The framework forces precision at each stage, preventing the drift that causes most conflict resolution efforts to fail.

### 1.2 Core Principle

**Name it → See it → Evaluate it → Choose it → Do it.**

### 1.3 The Journey

```
Map → Truth → Judgment → Decision → Action
```

| Stage | Activity | Output |
|-------|----------|--------|
| **Map** | Name |  |
| **Truth** | See | Reality |
| **Judgment** | Evaluate | What must be addressed |
| **Decision** | Choose | Resolution |
| **Action** | Do | Change |

### 1.4 The Five Stages at a Glance

| Stage | Activity (what you do) | Output (what you get) | Why it matters / What happens if you skip it |
|-------|------------------------|----------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **1: Map** | Name the conflict precisely | A clear structure (who is involved and exactly what they are fighting about) | Without boundaries, later stages drift or solve the wrong problem. |
| **2: Truth** | Establish what actually happened and what each party needs | Objective reality (facts, events, and the needs and interests of each party) | Arguments persist endlessly when each side operates from a different narrative. |
| **3: Judgment** | Evaluate what went wrong | What must be addressed (violations, failures, unmet needs, accountability) | You cannot fix what you do not understand caused the conflict. |
| **4: Decision** | Choose how to resolve the conflict | A specific intention (what will be done to address the conflict mapped in Stage 1) | Knowing what went wrong is not the same as deciding to act. |
| **5: Action** | Do the chosen thing | Actual change in the world | Most conflicts die here — talk without execution changes nothing. |

### 1.5 Core Questions

Each stage is driven by a core question. Answer it before moving forward.

| Stage | Question |
|-------|----------|
| **Map** | Who are the parties? What is the conflict? |
| **Truth** | What happened? What is real? What are the needs and interests of each party? |
| **Judgment** | What must be addressed? What went wrong? Who is accountable? |
| **Decision** | How do we resolve the conflict we mapped? |
| **Action** | How do we put the resolution into practice? |

### 1.6 Summary: Function, Question, and Tools

| Stage | Function | Question | Tools |
|-------|----------|----------|-------|
| **Map** | Define the conflict (scoping) | Who are the parties? What is the conflict? | Identify parties, positions, interests, main conflict, sub-conflicts |
| **Truth** | Establish what is real (fact-finding) | What happened? What is real? What are the needs and interests? | Evidence gathering, claims comparison, needs and interests identification |
| **Judgment** | Identify what must be addressed (backward-looking) | What must be addressed? What went wrong? Who is accountable? | Assessment of violations, failures, unmet needs, accountability |
| **Decision** | Choose how to resolve it (forward-looking) | How do we resolve the conflict we mapped? | L.E.R / B.U.S / A.C.T tests applied to proposed solutions |
| **Action** | Implement the resolution (execution) | How do we put the resolution into practice? | Concrete steps, responsibilities, timelines, follow-up |

## 2. Constraints

### 2.1 Pre-Check: Does This Situation Fit?

Not every frustration is a conflict. Before using this framework, confirm the situation qualifies.

### 2.2 When to Use This Framework

Use when **all** of the following are true:

1. There are at least two positions in genuine disagreement.
2. Each position is held by someone (or some group) who can choose and act.
3. You can state what the conflict is about in one sentence.
4. You know enough about the situation to sketch an initial map.

### 2.3 When NOT to Use This Framework

Do **not** use when:

1. There is only frustration, not a second position. ("I hate the traffic" is not a conflict — traffic cannot negotiate.)
2. The "other side" is a force of nature or the irreversible past. (No agent can respond.)
3. You cannot yet say what the fight is about. (You need more information before mapping.)

### 2.4 How to Begin

1. **Locate yourself.** Are you an observer, a party, or dealing with an internal conflict? Is this past, present, or future? (See Section 3.)
2. **Write your one-sentence conflict name.** "This is a conflict about …"
3. **Draft a first map.** List parties, their positions, and what each stands to gain or lose.
4. **Proceed through the stages.** Map → Truth → Judgment → Decision → Action.

## 3. Before You Begin: Locate Yourself

Before you start Stage 1 (Map), you must locate yourself relative to the conflict. Two dimensions set your coordinates.

### 3.1 Dimension 1: Position — What is your relationship to the conflict?

This determines whether you can affect the outcome, what blind spots to expect, and how hard it will be to see clearly.

| Position | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Observer** | You have no power to affect the outcome. You are analysing only. |
| **Party** | You have power to affect the outcome — whether as someone *in* the conflict, or someone with authority *over* it. |
| **Internal** | The conflict is within yourself. You are analyst, all parties, and the battlefield. |

#### 3.1.1 What counts as a "party"?

A party is anyone with power to change what happens:

- The people *in* the conflict (they can escalate, concede, act)
- A judge (they can decide)
- A parent mediating between children (they can intervene)
- A boss resolving a team dispute (they can impose)

#### 3.1.2 What counts as an "observer"?

An observer has no power over the outcome:

- A historian analysing a past war (it is over)
- A journalist reporting on a dispute (can observe, cannot decide)
- You analysing someone else's conflict with no involvement (just watching)

#### 3.1.3 Note on internal conflicts

Internal conflicts require stepping outside yourself to see your competing forces as if they were separate parties. This is the hardest application. Internal conflicts rarely stay internal — you must also identify who else is affected.

### 3.2 Dimension 2: Time — When is the conflict?

This determines what counts as evidence, whether action is possible, and whether your map is real or hypothetical.

| Time | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Past** | Already happened. Memory, documents, evidence. You know how it ended. |
| **Present** | Happening now. Real events, real claims, real parties. |
| **Future** | Has not played out yet. Projections, assumptions, scenarios. You are preparing. |

#### 3.2.1 Note on future mode

Your map is a hypothesis. You are simulating, not resolving. Until the conflict plays out, your map is incomplete. Simulation is preparation, not resolution.

### 3.3 What Each Combination Allows

| Time | Map | Truth | Judgment | Decision | Action |
|------|-----|-------|----------|----------|--------|
| **Past** | You can map | You can verify against evidence | You can judge with hindsight | Already decided | Already acted — you can learn |
| **Present** | You can map | You can verify against reality | You can judge | You can decide | You can act |
| **Future** | You can map | You are guessing — projections only | You are preparing | You are rehearsing | Not yet — simulation only |

### 3.4 Summary: The Pre-Check

| Question | Dimension | What it determines |
|----------|-----------|-------------------|
| What is my relationship to this conflict? | Position | Whether you can affect the outcome. Your blind spots. How hard it will be to see. |
| When is this conflict? | Time | What counts as evidence. Whether action is possible. Whether your map is real or hypothetical. |

**Before you map the conflict, you map your position relative to it.**

## Notes

### Note on Premature Resolution

If, after mapping the conflict, you discover the disagreement was a misunderstanding and everyone now agrees, stop. The framework resolved itself in Stage 1. This is success, not failure.

### Note on What Fuels the Movement

To move between the stages you will need energy. That energy can be anything that makes you "do it." When you sense fear, you might need courage to push forward. Sometimes what moves you forward is curiosity: the need to make sense of something that does not add up. Sometimes it is persistence, when there is exhaustion and you believe you simply cannot sustain the weight of unresolved conflict any longer — and you push forward regardless. Sometimes it is care: someone you love is affected, and that matters more than your own comfort. Sometimes it is integrity: the gap between what you know and what you are doing becomes unbearable.

Or perhaps it does not matter what moves you forward. What matters is that you do move forward. The framework runs on whatever force is strong enough to overcome what is holding you back.

### Note on Intention

This framework reveals the structure of conflict — who is involved, what they want, what is true, and what is hidden. It shows you accuracy (or it's lack of) in judgments made, points to failure when decisions had been been made and _

That knowledge is power. And power can be used in different ways.

If your intention is resolution — to end the conflict in a way that is fair and sustainable — this framework will guide you there.

But if your intention is to win at any cost — to use that truth as a weapon for your benefit — this framework will serve that too. 

The framework cannot protect you from that choice as that is not what this framework's function is. 

The framework purpose is to genuinely do your best to resolve conflict in a away that solution is sustainable and serves us all.

**The choice is yours.**
