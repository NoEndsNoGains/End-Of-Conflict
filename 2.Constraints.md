# End of Conflict

A five-stage framework for analysing and resolving conflicts — external disputes or internal dilemmas.

---

## 1. Overview

### 1.1 What is this?

The End of Conflict Framework is a systematic process for resolving conflicts that seem intractable. It applies to disputes between people, groups, or institutions, and to internal dilemmas within one person (modelled as competing "parties"). The framework forces precision at each stage, preventing the drift that causes most conflict resolution efforts to fail.

### 1.2 Core Principle

**Name it → Know it → Judge it → Choose it → Do it.**

### 1.3 The Journey

```
Map → Reality → Judgment → Decision → Action
```

### 1.4 The Five Stages

| Stage | Activity | Output | Question | What you get | Functional Logic | Medical Analogy | Role |
|-------|----------|--------|----------|--------------|------------------|-----------------|------|
| **Map** | Name it | Boundary | Who is involved? What is the territory of the fight? | Who fights over what | Defining the Scope | Presenting Problem | The Case |
| **Reality** | Know it | Clashes | What does each party say, do, want? Where do they clash? | The frictions between versions | The Data | Symptoms | The Cause |
| **Judgment** | Judge it | Consequences | What is the cost? What has been Violated, Concealed, Ignored? | The cost — Violated, Concealed, Ignored | The Damage Report | Diagnosis | The Effect |
| **Decision** | Choose it | Resolution | What path forward addresses the consequences? | The path to resolve the conflict | The Strategy | Treatment | The Cure |
| **Action** | Do it | Change | What will make it real? | Implemented steps, owners, timelines | The Implementation | Recovery | The Recovery |

### 1.5 The Chain: Case → Cause → Effect → Cure → Recovery

| Stage | Role | Example |
|-------|------|---------|
| **Map** | The Case | "This is the conflict we are examining." |
| **Reality** | The Cause | "We have a clash between Person A's Want and Person B's Do." |
| **Judgment** | The Effect | "Because of this clash, trust is Violated, progress is Stalled, morale is Ignored." |
| **Decision** | The Cure | "To address these consequences, we must do X, Y, and Z." |
| **Action** | The Recovery | "These are the steps, owners, and timelines to make it real." |

### 1.6 The Three Consequences

Judgment is an **Audit of Gaps** — the distance between what is and what should be.

| Consequence | What it captures | Examples |
|-------------|------------------|----------|
| **Violated** | What was broken | Rules, agreements, trust, integrity breached |
| **Concealed** | What was hidden | Facts, motives, truth withheld |
| **Ignored** | What was missed | Needs, fears, wants, losses unacknowledged |

**Note:** These are **lenses**, not boxes. They can overlap. Something can be both Concealed AND Ignored. You evaluate through all three.

This covers:
- **Accountability** (Violated)
- **Transparency** (Concealed)
- **Healing** (Ignored)

You are not judging the person. You are judging the impact of the friction.

### 1.7 Why This Works

- **Depersonalised** — You judge the impact, not the person
- **Scales** — Hurt feelings or lost revenue, same framework
- **Forces precision** — No consequences, no real conflict
- **Iterates** — Action closes the loop, or reveals the map was incomplete and the cycle begins again

### 1.8 The Final Test

Judgment asks: **"What is the cost of this conflict?"**

If you can't name a consequence (a Violation, a Concealment, or an Ignored need), there might not be a conflict worth resolving through this framework — or you haven't looked hard enough.

But if there is a cost, that cost dictates the Decision.

### 1.9 The Value Function

The framework is called "End of Conflict." The purpose is to **end conflict** in a way that:

- Is **sustainable** (doesn't reignite)
- **Serves all parties** (or as many as possible)
- Is **fair** (L.E.R tests: Legal, Ethical, Reversible)
- Is **wise** (B.U.S tests: Benefit, Universal, Sustainable)
- Is **doable** (A.C.T tests: Assets, Capability, Timely)

**The value function:** Resolve conflict sustainably and fairly.

It's not purely Pareto (someone may have to lose). Not purely rights-based (though L.E.R includes rights). Not purely restorative (though it can be).

It's **pragmatic resolution with ethical constraints.**

## 2. Constraints

### 2.1 Pre-Check: Does This Situation Fit?

Not every frustration is a conflict. Before using this framework, confirm the situation qualifies.

### 2.2 When to Use This Framework

Use when **all** of the following are true:

1. There are at least two positions in genuine disagreement.
2. Each position is held by someone (or some group) who can choose and act.
3. You can state what the conflict is about in one sentence.
4. You know enough about the situation to sketch an initial map.

### 2.3 When NOT to Use This Framework

Do **not** use when:

1. There is only frustration, not a second position. ("I hate the traffic" is not a conflict — traffic cannot negotiate.)
2. The "other side" is a force of nature or the irreversible past. (No agent can respond.)
3. You cannot yet say what the fight is about. (You need more information before mapping.)

### 2.4 How to Begin

1. **Locate yourself.** Are you an observer, a party, or dealing with an internal conflict? Is this past, present, or future? (See Section 3.)
2. **Write your one-sentence conflict name.** "This is a conflict about …"
3. **Draft a first map.** List parties, their positions, and what each stands to gain or lose.
4. **Proceed through the stages.** Map → Reality → Judgment → Decision → Action.

## 3. Before You Begin: Locate Yourself

Before you start Stage 1 (Map), you must locate yourself relative to the conflict. Two dimensions set your coordinates.

### 3.1 Dimension 1: Position — What is your relationship to the conflict?

This determines whether you can affect the outcome, what blind spots to expect, and how hard it will be to see clearly.

| Position | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Observer** | You have no power to affect the outcome. You are analysing only. |
| **Party** | You have power to affect the outcome — whether as someone *in* the conflict, or someone with authority *over* it. |
| **Internal** | The conflict is within yourself. You are analyst, all parties, and the battlefield. |

#### 3.1.1 What counts as a "party"?

A party is anyone with power to change what happens:

- The people *in* the conflict (they can escalate, concede, act)
- A judge (they can decide)
- A parent mediating between children (they can intervene)
- A boss resolving a team dispute (they can impose)

#### 3.1.2 What counts as an "observer"?

An observer has no power over the outcome:

- A historian analysing a past war (it is over)
- A journalist reporting on a dispute (can observe, cannot decide)
- You analysing someone else's conflict with no involvement (just watching)

#### 3.1.3 Note on internal conflicts

Internal conflicts require stepping outside yourself to see your competing forces as if they were separate parties. This is the hardest application. Internal conflicts rarely stay internal — you must also identify who else is affected.

### 3.2 Dimension 2: Time — When is the conflict?

This determines what counts as evidence, whether action is possible, and whether your map is real or hypothetical.

| Time | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Past** | Already happened. Memory, documents, evidence. You know how it ended. |
| **Present** | Happening now. Real events, real claims, real parties. |
| **Future** | Has not played out yet. Projections, assumptions, scenarios. You are preparing. |

#### 3.2.1 Note on future mode

Your map is a hypothesis. You are simulating, not resolving. Until the conflict plays out, your map is incomplete. Simulation is preparation, not resolution.

### 3.3 What Each Combination Allows

| Time | Map | Reality | Judgment | Decision | Action |
|------|-----|---------|----------|----------|--------|
| **Past** | You can map | You can verify against evidence | You can judge with hindsight | Already decided | Already acted — you can learn |
| **Present** | You can map | You can verify against reality | You can judge | You can decide | You can act |
| **Future** | You can map | You are guessing — projections only | You are preparing | You are rehearsing | Not yet — simulation only |

### 3.4 Summary: The Pre-Check

| Question | Dimension | What it determines |
|----------|-----------|-------------------|
| What is my relationship to this conflict? | Position | Whether you can affect the outcome. Your blind spots. How hard it will be to see. |
| When is this conflict? | Time | What counts as evidence. Whether action is possible. Whether your map is real or hypothetical. |

**Before you map the conflict, you map your position relative to it.**

## 5. Stress Tests

### 5.1 Stress Test: Competing Legitimate Goods

**Scenario:** Two parents in a divorce both want primary custody. Neither has done anything wrong. Both love the child. Both are good parents.

| Stage | What happens |
|-------|--------------|
| **Map** | Conflict is over custody. Parties: Parent A, Parent B, Child. |
| **Reality** | Both say they want primary custody. Both do care for the child well. Both want time and stability. **Clash:** Both want something only one can fully have. |
| **Judgment** | Violated? No — no rules broken. Concealed? No — both are honest. **Ignored?** Yes — each party's legitimate need is at risk of being dismissed by the other's claim. **Consequence:** Someone's needs will be unmet. The child may be caught in the middle. |
| **Decision** | Choose a resolution that addresses the consequences — shared custody, specific arrangements, compromise. |
| **Action** | Implement it. |

**Conclusion:** The framework works. "Ignored" captures legitimate needs at risk of being unmet — even when no one is at fault. Consequences exist even without wrongdoing. The cost of the impasse is real.

### 5.2 Stress Test: Latent and Future Conflict

**Question:** Can this framework handle latent conflict (tension that hasn't erupted) or future conflict (anticipated)?

**Answer:** Yes. The Time dimension (Past, Present, Future) explicitly covers this:

- **Future mode:** Your map is a hypothesis. You are simulating, not resolving. You can Map, project Reality, prepare Judgment, rehearse Decision — but Action is not yet possible. Simulation is preparation, not resolution.
- **Latent conflict:** If tension exists but consequences cannot be named, it's either not yet a conflict worth resolving, or you haven't looked hard enough. The framework prompts deeper investigation.

## 6. Key Clarifications

### 6.1 On the Two Chains

The two chains align precisely:

| Stage | Activity | Role |
|-------|----------|------|
| Map | Name it | The Case |
| Reality | Know it | The Cause |
| Judgment | Judge it | The Effect |
| Decision | Choose it | The Cure |
| Action | Do it | The Recovery |

Reality shows the **Clashes** (what is causing the damage). Judgment shows the **Consequences** (the effect of those clashes). The clashes ARE the cause; the consequences ARE the effect.

### 6.2 On Decision vs Action

- **Decision** = Choosing the path (the strategy, the plan, the commitment) — The Verdict
- **Action** = Implementing the path (steps, owners, timelines, execution) — The Sentence

Decision is what you will do. Action is doing it.

### 6.3 On "Clashes" Being Descriptive

"Clashes" describes where versions conflict — that's data. The **evaluation** of those clashes (what they cost) happens in Judgment. Reality is descriptive; Judgment is evaluative.

### 6.4 On Fairness, Rights, and Long-term Effects

The Decision stage includes the L.E.R / B.U.S / A.C.T tests:

- **L.E.R** = Legal, Ethical, Reversible (fairness, rights)
- **B.U.S** = Benefit, Universal, Sustainable (long-term effects)
- **A.C.T** = Assets, Capability, Timely (feasibility)

These ensure decisions consider more than just "addressing consequences."

### 6.5 On Iteration and Feedback Loops

The framework is not strictly linear. Action closes the loop — or reveals that the map was incomplete, and the cycle begins again. Each stage produces provisional outputs subject to update as new information emerges.

### 6.6 On Structural vs Operational Causes

In the Map stage, sub-conflicts are typed as:

- **Operational** = Proximate triggers (what to do)
- **Structural** = Underlying conditions (who decides)

This distinguishes surface symptoms from root causes.

## Notes

### Note on Premature Resolution

If, after mapping the conflict, you discover the disagreement was a misunderstanding and everyone now agrees, stop. The framework resolved itself in Stage 1. This is success, not failure.

### Note on What Fuels the Movement

To move between the stages you will need energy. That energy can be anything that makes you "do it." When you sense fear, you might need courage to push forward. Sometimes what moves you forward is curiosity: the need to make sense of something that does not add up. Sometimes it is persistence, when there is exhaustion and you believe you simply cannot sustain the weight of unresolved conflict any longer — and you push forward regardless. Sometimes it is care: someone you love is affected, and that matters more than your own comfort. Sometimes it is integrity: the gap between what you know and what you are doing becomes unbearable.

Or perhaps it does not matter what moves you forward. What matters is that you do move forward. The framework runs on whatever force is strong enough to overcome what is holding you back.

### Note on Intention

This framework reveals the structure of conflict — who is involved, what they want, what is true, and what is hidden. It shows you accuracy (or its lack) in judgments made, points to failure when decisions have been made.

That knowledge is power. And power can be used in different ways.

If your intention is resolution — to end the conflict in a way that is fair and sustainable — this framework will guide you there.

But if your intention is to win at any cost — to use that truth as a weapon for your benefit — this framework will serve that too.

The framework cannot protect you from that choice as that is not what this framework's function is.

The framework's purpose is to genuinely do your best to resolve conflict in a way that the solution is sustainable and serves us all.

**The choice is yours.**

### Note on Gaming and Manipulation

The framework acknowledges that actors may strategically misrepresent costs, exaggerate clashes, or game the process. The CHECK step in Reality (asking "What is MY own want?") and the Note on Intention address this directly: the framework reveals truth, but cannot force honest use.

### Note on Power

Who gets to Map, Judge, and Choose? The Position dimension (Observer, Party, Internal) addresses your relationship to the conflict and your power to affect outcomes. Power asymmetries between parties are real — the framework surfaces them but does not eliminate them.
