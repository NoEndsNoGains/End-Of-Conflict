LION — DECIDEs

Lion Decides on what Eagle Saw

Because a verdict isn't a solution. The problem remains until someone decides what to do about it.

How do we resolve this so it doesn't return?
Because a solution is "never again" — not "here we go again."

Owl turned on the lights. Lion sees.

But seeing isn't deciding. And deciding on the branch — when you saw the root — isn't a solution. It's postponement.

Lion's enemy isn't blindness. Lion already sees. Lion's enemy is the fix that protects Lion from having to change. The branch gets cut. The root grows back. Here we go again.

A solution that lets the problem return isn't a solution. It's a time bomb.

Note: Judgment (Owl) is backward — what happened, what it cost. Decision (Lion) is forward — what to do about the problem.

Owl may find no one did wrong. Lion still has a problem to solve.

Lion asks: Does what I decide pass?

L.E.R — Is it right? (Legal, Ethical, Relational)
B.U.S — Is it wise? (Beneficial, Unintended consequences considered, Sustainable)
A.C.T — Is it doable? (Achievable, Clear, Timely)
Fails any test — not a solution. A time bomb.

Lion checks Lion: What do I say, do, want, hide, miss — or don't want to see?

Lion roars. Ant hears.
