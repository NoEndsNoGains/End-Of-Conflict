LION — DECIDEs

Lion Decides on what Eagle Saw

Because a verdict isn't a solution. The problem remains until someone decides what to do about it.

How do we resolve this so it doesn't return?
Because a solution is "never again" — not "here we go again."

Owl turned on the lights. Lion sees.

But seeing isn't deciding. And deciding on the branch — when you saw the root — isn't a solution. It's postponement.

Lion's enemy isn't blindness. Lion already sees. Lion's enemy is the fix that protects Lion from having to change. The branch gets cut. The root grows back. Here we go again.

A solution that lets the problem return isn't a solution. It's a time bomb.

Note: Judgment (Owl) is backward — what happened, what it cost. Decision (Lion) is forward — what to do about the problem.

Owl may find no one did wrong. Lion still has a problem to solve.

Lion asks: Does what I decide pass?

L.E.R — Is it right? (Legal, Ethical, Relational)
B.U.S — Is it wise? (Beneficial, Unintended consequences considered, Sustainable)
A.C.T — Is it doable? (Achievable, Clear, Timely)
Fails any test — not a solution. A time bomb.

Lion checks Lion: What do I say, do, want, hide, miss — or don't want to see?

Lion roars. Ant hears.

What JUDGMENT Evaluates
JUDGMENT identifies the gap between truth and what was presented, acted upon, or suppressed:
CategoryQuestionDeceptionWhat was lied about?ConcealmentWhat was hidden?NeglectWhat needs were ignored or dismissed?MistakesWhat errors were made?MiscommunicationWhat was misunderstood or poorly communicated?AccountabilityWho bears responsibility, and for what?

The Evaluation Process
For each sub-conflict, ask:

What should have happened? (Based on rules, agreements, reasonable expectations)
What actually happened? (Established in Stage 2)
Where is the gap?
What caused the gap? (Deception / Concealment / Neglect / Mistakes / Miscommunication)
Who is responsible?
What must be addressed before resolution is possible?


JUDGMENT — Fill in (per sub-conflict):
Sub-conflictWhat should have happenedWhat actually happenedThe gapCauseWho is responsibleWhat must be addressed

Stage 3 Output
At the end of Stage 3, you have:

✓ Violations identified (deception, concealment)
✓ Failures identified (neglect, mistakes, miscommunication)
✓ Unmet needs identified
✓ Accountability assigned (who is responsible for what)
✓ What must be addressed before resolution is possible


The Link to Stage 4
Stage 3 tells you what went wrong — the violations, failures, and accountability.


DECISION answers: Of what is possible, what do we choose to do?
DECISION is about resolving the conflict. How do we address the original conflict that we mapped in Stage 1?

## The Three Tests: Philosophical Foundation

The three tests are not arbitrary. They represent the three major traditions of ethical reasoning, ensuring comprehensive evaluation from multiple angles:

| Test | Philosophical Tradition | Domain | Core Question |
|------|------------------------|--------|---------------|
| **L.E.R** | Deontological (Kant, rules) | Permissibility in principle | Is it RIGHT? |
| **B.U.S** | Consequentialist (utility) | Prudence and effects | Is it WISE? |
| **A.C.T** | Pragmatic (feasibility) | Practical execution | Is it DOABLE? |

Together, these tests prevent common decision pitfalls: doing something legal but unwise, wise but impossible, or possible but wrong.

## Overview: The Three Tests

| Test | Name | Acronym | Question | Finds what's wrong with |
|------|------|---------|----------|------------------------|
| **1** | RIGHT | L.E.R | Is this RIGHT? | The PRINCIPLE |
| **2** | WISE | B.U.S | Is this WISE? | The OUTCOME |
| **3** | DOABLE | A.C.T | Is this DOABLE? | The EXECUTION |

---

## Test 1: RIGHT — Is this RIGHT?

### L.E.R TEST

**Aim:** To determine if the WANT is fundamentally LEGITIMATE and permissible in principle.

| Letter | Name | Function | Focus Question |
|--------|------|----------|----------------|
| **L** | LEGAL | Rules Check | Is the WANT ALLOWED by laws, regulations, contracts, or formal agreements? |
| **E** | ETHICAL | Morality Check | Is the WANT MORALLY RIGHT? (fair, safe, respectful, not harmful) |
| **R** | REVERSIBLE | Mirror Check | Would I accept this WANT if applied TO ME? (Verifies L and E) |

### The Mirror Check (R): Why It Matters

The Reversible test — "Would I accept this if applied to me?" — is the ultimate gut-check. It catches self-serving rationalisations that slip through abstract ethical reasoning. People can justify almost anything in the abstract, but when forced to imagine the same treatment applied to themselves, hypocrisy becomes visible.

This test operationalises what philosophers call the Golden Rule — one of the oldest and most universal ethical principles in human history.

### The Golden Rule: Universal Foundation

The principle of treating others as one would wish to be treated appears independently across virtually all human cultures and traditions:

- **Confucius (551–479 BCE):** "Do not do to others what you do not want them to do to you."
- **Buddhism:** "Hurt not others in ways that you yourself would find hurtful."
- **Judaism (Hillel):** "What is hateful to you, do not do to your fellow."
- **Christianity (Matthew 7:12):** "Do to others what you would have them do to you."
- **Islam:** "None of you truly believes until he loves for his brother what he loves for himself."

This near-universal presence suggests the principle arises from basic human empathy and the requirements of social cooperation. The Mirror Check harnesses this ancient wisdom as a practical test.

---

## Test 2: WISE — Is this WISE?

### B.U.S TEST

**Aim:** To determine if the WANT produces GOOD OUTCOMES across impact, scale, and time.

| Letter | Name | Function | Focus Question |
|--------|------|----------|----------------|
| **B** | BENEFIT | Impact Check | Who gains? Who loses? Is there net positive impact? |
| **U** | UNIVERSAL | Scale Check | Would the positive effects still hold if everyone adopted this WANT? |
| **S** | SUSTAINABLE | Duration Check | Do the positive effects last over time? |

This test evaluates consequences. Something can be legally permitted and ethically defensible in principle, yet still be unwise — producing more harm than benefit, working only if others don't do it, or creating short-term gains that collapse over time.

---

## Test 3: DOABLE — Is this DOABLE?

### A.C.T TEST

**Aim:** To determine if the WANT is FEASIBLE and can actually be executed.

| Letter | Name | Function | Focus Question |
|--------|------|----------|----------------|
| **A** | ASSETS | Resources Check | Are the necessary resources available? (money, time, people, tools) |
| **C** | CAPABILITY | Execution Check | Can the steps actually be carried out? (skills, process, authority) |
| **T** | TIMELY | Timing Check | Is it achievable within the required timeframe and current constraints? |

This test is purely practical. It does not judge whether the WANT is right or wise — only whether it can actually happen given current resources, capabilities, and constraints.

---

## The Decision Rule: Hierarchy of Tests

> **CRITICAL RULE**
>
> Reject any WANT that fails L.E.R or B.U.S, even if A.C.T passes.
>
> Only among WANTs that pass the first two tests should you use A.C.T to choose or plan implementation.

This hierarchy is essential. Without it, people justify wrong actions because they are easy. The tests must be applied in order:

1. **L.E.R first** — Is it RIGHT in principle?
2. **B.U.S second** — Is it WISE in outcomes?
3. **A.C.T last** — Is it DOABLE in practice?

A WANT that fails L.E.R or B.U.S is rejected — full stop. The fact that it passes A.C.T ("we can get away with it") is irrelevant. A.C.T only matters for WANTs that have already passed the first two tests.

---

## Worked Example: Phone Conflict

Two parents in a custody dispute disagree about phone parental controls. Each has a WANT. Let's test them.

### Father's WANT: Separate Control

*"I will set parental controls independently during my parenting time, without consulting Mother."*

| Test | Result | Reasoning |
|------|--------|-----------|
| **L (Legal)** | ✗ Fails | Violates court order (Schedule G) requiring joint decision-making |
| **E (Ethical)** | ✗ Fails | Unfair to child (inconsistent rules) and mother (excluded from decision) |
| **R (Reversible)** | ✗ Fails | Would father accept mother unilaterally overriding his decisions? No. |
| **B.U.S** | ✗ Fails | Child loses (inconsistency), not sustainable, not universal |
| **A.C.T** | ✓ Passes | Already happening — easy to execute |

**Verdict:** EASY but WRONG. Fails L.E.R and B.U.S. The fact that it passes A.C.T is irrelevant.

---

### Mother's WANT: Shared Control

*"We will agree on consistent parental controls that apply in both homes."*

| Test | Result | Reasoning |
|------|--------|-----------|
| **L (Legal)** | ✓ Passes | Complies with court order requiring joint decision-making |
| **E (Ethical)** | ✓ Passes | Fair to child (consistency) and both parents (equal input) |
| **R (Reversible)** | ✓ Passes | Mother would accept shared decision-making applied to her? Yes. |
| **B.U.S** | ✓ Passes | Child benefits, sustainable over time, works if universalised |
| **A.C.T** | ⚠ Partial | Requires father's cooperation — implementation barrier |

**Verdict:** RIGHT but HARD. Passes L.E.R and B.U.S. The partial A.C.T result tells us what's needed for implementation — not whether the WANT should be chosen.

---

### What the Tests Reveal

| Father's Position | Mother's Position |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Easy but WRONG** | **Right but HARD** |

The decision becomes clear: **The WANT that passes L.E.R and B.U.S should be chosen. A.C.T tells you what's needed to IMPLEMENT it.**

---

## Stage 3 Output

At the end of Stage 3, you have:

- ✓ Each candidate WANT tested against L.E.R (Right)
- ✓ Each candidate WANT tested against B.U.S (Wise)
- ✓ Each candidate WANT tested against A.C.T (Doable)
- ✓ Clear verdict: which WANTs pass, which fail, and why
- ✓ Implementation barriers identified (from A.C.T results)

---

## The Link to Stage 4

Stage 3 tells you what OUGHT to be — which WANTs are right and wise.

But knowing what ought to be is not the same as choosing to do it.

Stage 4 (Decision) takes the evaluated WANTs and asks: Given what is right and wise, what will you actually commit to doing? This is where judgment becomes intention.

## Full Pipeline Summary

> **MAP → TRUTH → JUDGMENT → DECISION → ACTION**

> *Name it → See it → Judge it → Choose it → Do it*

For Stage 3 specifically:

> **L.E.R → B.U.S → A.C.T → DECIDE**
>
> *"Is it Right? Is it Wise? Can we Act? Then Decide."*

## Working Template: Stage 3 Grid

Use this grid to evaluate each candidate WANT from Stage 2:

| WANT | L.E.R | B.U.S | A.C.T | Verdict |
|------|-------|-------|-------|---------|
| Party A's WANT | ✓ / ✗ / ⚠ | ✓ / ✗ / ⚠ | ✓ / ✗ / ⚠ | Pass / Fail / Notes |
| Party B's WANT | ✓ / ✗ / ⚠ | ✓ / ✗ / ⚠ | ✓ / ✗ / ⚠ | Pass / Fail / Notes |

**Remember:** A WANT must pass L.E.R AND B.U.S to be considered. A.C.T only determines implementation, not selection.
