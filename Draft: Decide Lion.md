**LION — DECIDEs**

**Lion Decides on what Eagle Saw**

*Because a verdict isn't a solution. The problem remains until someone decides what to do about it.*

- How do we resolve this so it doesn't return?

*Because a solution is "never again" — not "here we go again."*

Owl turned on the lights. Lion sees.

But seeing isn't deciding. And deciding on the branch — when you saw the root — isn't a solution. It's postponement.

Lion's enemy isn't blindness. Lion already sees. Lion's enemy is the fix that protects Lion from having to change. The branch gets cut. The root grows back. Here we go again.

A solution that lets the problem return isn't a solution. It's a time bomb.

> **Note:** Judgment (Owl) is backward — what happened, what it cost. Decision (Lion) is forward — what to do about the problem.

Owl may find no one did wrong. Lion still has a problem to solve.

Lion asks: Does what I decide pass?
- **L.E.R** — Is it right? (Legal, Ethical, Relational)
- **B.U.S** — Is it wise? (Beneficial, Unintended consequences considered, Sustainable)
- **A.C.T** — Is it doable? (Achievable, Clear, Timely)

Fails any test — not a solution. A time bomb.

Lion checks Lion: What do I say, do, want, hide, miss — or don't want to see?

Lion roars. Ant hears.

----
First of all thing: This is going to be soooo much fun: It's like solving a puzle piece of milion little pieaces.
First all you need to call Eagel, Bloodhunt and Own in front of you. 
The job is not to decide on anything as of yet. You just need to pull all information together: Like a vacum cleaner. 

From Eagel: 
a) What he saw
b) BUT WHAT HE DID NOT SEE/COULD NOT SEE (FOG, outside of the horizon but still a problem; what he saw but did not report on, e.g. the old fights,but somehow old but grass does not grow there (e.g. court decided they won't be looked at)
c) Evaluate this shadow


From Bloodhunt
a)
b) 
c)so it's like Lion consideres the best and worst of each of them - isnt't?????/ is that? but look I am already Lion with problems - I have my assuptions about it?

From Own:
a)
b)
c)

From me: 
a) I cna't - Ant will do it for me
b) I can't - Ant will do it for me
c) I can - these are my assuptiosn e.g. Mother is controling, she writes too much, she contrlled father thought the GPS


## Example thought a real family conflict 2020 - 20206 - focus on a last year proceedigns only:


**What Lion Receives**
**A) From Eagle (The Map)**
Main Conflict: Parental responsibility coordination dispute
Sub-conflicts:

- Phone parental controls
- Dental care coordination
- Therapy arrangements

Type: Both Operational and Structural
Even though These look operational (who gets what settings, which dentist) but they keep returning. The structural question underneath: Who gets to decide?

I. OPERATIONAL (Surface fights — "what to do")
IssueStatusNotePhoneBefore court5 solutions rejected; now two phonesDentistBefore courtDual registration; conflicting clinical pathsTherapyBefore courtPattern: arrange → inform after → invoke GillickHairFORBIDDENCourt ruled "day-to-day" — but consequences persist (Ela in tears, appointment override, no coordination)
Lion notes: Hair is declared non-operational by external authority. But the pattern (unilateral override → child distress → no recourse) is identical to the three that ARE before court. The debris remains on the field even if Eagle is told not to fly over it.

II. STRUCTURAL (Underneath — "who decides")
IssueStatusMechanism"Lives with"CLOSED by appealCreates information control, institutional default, enforcement power. Appeal ruling: "could identify no such thing" as disadvantage. Mother told she cannot raise this.Half-termsNot in current applicationEvidence shows: 9 months notice → refused → "sustained calm needed" → father holds veto indefinitely. Pattern visible but not formally mapped.Para 10(b) TravelOLD DEBRISMentioned in appeal; school permission requirement = father can veto travel by withholding agreement. Not in current paperwork. How would court know mother is still thinking about this?
Lion notes: These are the authority questions. Phone/dentist/therapy keep recurring because the structural question — who has the right to decide — remains unresolved. Court has ruled mother cannot challenge the structural foundation. So she can only fight branches. Branches regrow.

Hidden Player: The "lives with" designation — creates information control (institutions default to father), enforcement power (can veto flexibility), and framing advantage ("stability" = status quo = his arrangements)
b) BUT WHAT HE DID NOT SEE/COULD NOT SEE (FOG, outside of the horizon but still a problem; what he saw but did not report on, e.g. the old fights,but somehow old but grass does not grow there (e.g. court decided they won't be looked at)
- Hair Conflict
- Half-Term Conflict
- Travel Section Conflict

c) What is his shadow????
???





From Bloodhound (The Verified Data)
IssueFather SAYSFather DOESGapPhone"My boundaries"; "linked to my account"; Apple would expose card detailsRejected 5 solutions including neutral device with no financial links; blocked neutral phone from his homeApple confirms card details not exposed (Exhibit 23). Stated reason contradicted by Apple's own documentationDental"Children's needs are being met"; "both practices aware"; "Station Road unreliable"Started WP 2021 without agreement; announced as permanent; made orthodontic referral contradicting SR's clinical advice; WP records show "attended with mum" — mother never attendedDual registration without consent; falsified attendance records; conflicting clinical pathways createdTherapy"Ela is Gillick competent"; "mother was informed"; "you know as much as I do"Arranged Somewhere House, YouTrust, Emma — each time mother learned from child or third party; stepmother texted Ela "Emma?" → "Email sent"Mother learned May 2025 therapy from Ela. Father's response: "Please do not copy me into your messages with Emma"
Pattern Bloodhound found across all three:

Arrangement made unilaterally
Mother informed after (or learns from child)
Justification shifts: "my boundaries" → "day-to-day" → "Gillick competence" → "parallel parenting" → "sustained calm needed"
Each justification eliminates consultation requirement

BUT:
B) BLOODHOUNT CAN NOT SNIFED ON WHAT HAS BEEN MISSED BY EAGEL IN B (lION WILL NEED TO DOUBLE CHECK THAT LATER ON)
C) What is his shadow


From Owl (The Verdict)
Is there anything to judge? if so, what???
What was violated - has to do all of the:
What was violated? (broken — rules, agreements, trust)
What was concealed? (hidden — facts, motives, truth)
What was ignored? (missed — needs, fears, losses)
Who is accountable for what?
What requires no accountability?
Focus is not on people. Focus is on consequences.

What was violated? (broken — rules, agreements, trust)
Schedule F: "shall share and consult in advance" — not followed
Schedule G: "open and transparent...no restrictions" — father's interpretation (device passcode = compliance) contradicts plain meaning
Judge Prigg (April 2025): PR is "joint and equal...not a competition" — functionally undermined - Judge was speaking about mother?????
COMMUNICATION??????

What was concealed:(hidden — facts, motives, truth)

Calendar entries without practice names
Therapy arranged before OFW notification
WP records logging mother as attendee when she never attended

What was ignored (missed - needs, fears, lossses)

Mother's PR rights being systematically bypassed
Child placed as messenger/information carrier
Impact on Ela: two phones, fragmented dental records, caught between parents on therapy

Who is accountable:

Father: Pattern of unilateral action followed by post-hoc justification
System: "Lives with" designation enables information asymmetry
Mother: Extensive documentation may appear controlling (but Owl notes: this is response to pattern, not cause of it); did she controlled father through GPS tracking; she introduced the 2nd Phone - she crated harm in the first place (she even dropped the phone to the father)


THIS IS WHAT i AM NOT SURE ABOUT: IS OUT OF THIS BLOODHOUNT OR OWL???
III. THE UNNAMED — Problems that exist but have no category
A. Communication
What it isWhy it's a problemWhy it's "not a problem"Father disengages ("please see previous message"), copy-pastes old responses, refuses to sign messages, blocks coordination attemptsCannot exercise PR without information exchangeCourt has not identified this as actionable. OFW exists. Messages are sent. Therefore "communication is happening."
Lion asks: If a message is sent but coordination is impossible, is communication occurring? Or is the form of communication being used to prevent the function?

B. Gaslighting / Coercion Pattern
What Bloodhound foundWhat it might mean"My reasons are not for you to try and solve"Assertion of absolute boundary that eliminates negotiation"It is your choice whether the phone travels"Frames mother's response to his refusal as HER creating the problemEla told: "can't give you the passcode because credit card info" → Apple confirms this is falseChild given false explanation that positions mother as potential threat"Sustained calm needed before considering"Circular: making request = unrest; unrest = reason to refuse; refusing = maintaining calmMother's attempts to coordinate = "controlling behaviour" (para 10-11, father's statement)Her response to exclusion reframed as the original problem
Lion asks: Is this a problem to be SOLVED? Or a pattern to be NAMED? Bloodhound found the trail. But what Owl category does it fit?

Not "What was violated" (no specific rule breach)
Not "What was concealed" (it's in plain sight)
Not "What was missed" (needs, fears)
It's: How the game is structured so one party cannot win


C. Inability to Coordinate
EvidenceWhat it shows5 phone solutions rejectedNot "can't find solution" — "won't accept any solution"Mediation declined multiple timesNot "failed mediation" — "refused to enter""We will disengage when our position has been made clear"Coordination requires two. One has withdrawn from the process itself.Father's proposed resolution (para 56): Each household manages own devices/arrangementsThis IS his solution: parallel lives, no coordination
Lion asks: If father's stated preference is no coordination, and mother's PR requires coordination, then:

Is this a problem to be solved?
Or an incompatibility to be named?
Can Lion decide "we will coordinate" when one party has explicitly opted out?


D. The "Peace and Calm" Paradox
Let me trace this logic as Lion sees it:
Mother requests half-term swap (9 months notice, child-focused, fair rotation)
    ↓
Father refuses: "need sustained period of calm"
    ↓
Mother asks: "When would be appropriate to raise this?"
    ↓
Father: "We will not be considering proposals unless there has been sustained period of calm"
    ↓
Mother asks again
    ↓
This is now "not calm" — request becomes evidence of unrest
    ↓
Therefore request cannot be granted
    ↓
THEREFORE: Father decides when calm exists
    ↓
THEREFORE: Father decides when mother may request
    ↓
THEREFORE: Father decides everything
Lion asks: This is not a problem to be solved. It is a trap to be named. What category is this?


What Lion Must Now Decide
Lion holds all of this and asks: Given what Eagle saw, what Bloodhound verified, and what Owl judged — what do I do?
The core dilemma:
What's RIGHT (passes L.E.R)What's HARD (A.C.T barrier)Single coordinated dental practiceRequires father's cooperationEqual parental control of phoneFather has blocked all solutionsAdvance consultation on therapyFather frames Gillick as eliminating requirementStructural remedy (address "lives with" power)Court has ruled mother cannot vary this

Lion's Question to you:
You're the Lion now. Given everything above:

For each sub-conflict: What resolution would pass L.E.R and B.U.S?
What is within your micro-agency? (What can Ant actually carry?)
What must be named as inaccessible? (What you cannot fix alone, but can document for the record?)

This is what the Lion chapter needs to teach: how to hold the whole map, receive the verdict, and choose — even when the right answer is hard and the other party won't cooperate.

IV. LION'S QUESTIONS BEFORE DECIDING

What is actually before me?

Three operational issues (phone, dentist, therapy)
But the pattern across all three is the real problem
And the structural issues that CREATE the pattern are ruled off-limits


What exists but cannot be spoken?

Hair (day-to-day)
Lives with (appeal rejected)
Communication dysfunction (not identified as problem)
The coordination impossibility (father's stated preference)


What Owl ruled vs. what is still true?

Court (external Owl) has made rulings
But Owl's job is to judge consequences, not declare reality
If Owl says "no problem" but the problem persists — what does Lion do?


What is the question I must roar?
Not: "How do we share phone controls?"
But: "Can PR be exercised when one party has explicitly withdrawn from coordination, and the system rewards that withdrawal?"


V. WHAT LION SEES THAT NO ONE ELSE WILL NAME
The operational issues are decoys.
Every time mother solves one:

A new one emerges (same pattern)
Or the solution is rejected (5 phone solutions)
Or it's ruled "day-to-day" (hair)
Or compliance is reinterpreted ("open access" = device passcode only)

The structural issues are locked.

Appeal rejected variation
S.91(14) limits applications
Mother told her attempts to address = "misuse"

The real conflict is:
One parent wants coordination. One parent wants autonomy. The system has granted autonomy and called it "stability."

What Lion Now Holds
Before any decision:

 Three operational issues with identical pattern
 Structural foundation ruled unreachable
 Unnamed problems: communication, gaslighting, coordination impossibility, circular logic trap
 Debris from old fights still affecting the field
 External Owl (court) rulings that contradict internal Owl findings
 A paradox: Mother cannot win by playing. Cannot stop playing (children involved). Cannot change rules (appeal rejected).


Lion's pre-decision question to you:
Now that it's all gathered — what does Lion need to decide ABOUT?

The three issues?
The pattern?
The structural trap?
What to do when the right answer is "this cannot be resolved within this system"?
What to document for the record even if no remedy is available?

Lion sees. What does Lion choose to address?Claude is AI and can make mistakes. Please double-check responses.



now most importnatly: THERE IS SOMETHING ELSE - WOULD THSE CONFLICT BE DIFFERENTLY NAME BY THE FATHER - FROM A PERSPECTIVE OF THE FATHER???? HE WOULD SAY - THERE IS NO CONFLICT - MOTHER CREATES IT.  - WHAT IS THE CONFLICT AS SEEN FROM THE OTHER PARTY? THAT COMPARION ALLOWS FOR WHAT?????





































Core Content to Add from Draft
1. The Three Tests Framework (full detail)

L.E.R breakdown: Legal (rules check), Ethical (morality check), Reversible (mirror check)
B.U.S breakdown: Beneficial (impact), Universal (scale), Sustainable (duration)
A.C.T breakdown: Assets (resources), Capability (execution), Timely (timing)

2. Philosophical Foundation
The connection to ethical traditions:

L.E.R = Deontological (Kant, rules)
B.U.S = Consequentialist (utility)
A.C.T = Pragmatic (feasibility)

3. The Golden Rule section
The "Mirror Check" reasoning with cross-cultural citations (Confucius, Buddhism, Judaism, Christianity, Islam) — this grounds the Reversible test.
4. The Decision Rule Hierarchy
The critical rule: Reject any WANT that fails L.E.R or B.U.S, even if A.C.T passes. Tests must be applied in order.
5. The Worked Example (Phone Conflict)
Father's WANT vs Mother's WANT tested against all three tests — showing "Easy but WRONG" vs "Right but HARD."
6. The backward/forward distinction

Owl = backward-looking (what happened)
Lion = forward-looking (what to do about it)

7. Section 2.8: Why You Play All Roles
The courtroom fragmentation analogy — powerful for explaining why Lion must hold the whole cycle.

What's Missing from Both
What neither document fully develops for Lion:

How Lion handles competing WANTs that both pass L.E.R and B.U.S — tie-breakers
Lion's shadow (Tyrant) — mentioned in the cheat sheet table but not explored
The "Lion checks Lion" self-interrogation — needs its own section like the other animals get
When Lion must decide not to decide — strategic waiting vs paralysis

Would you like me to help structure a full Lion chapter integrating these elements?
Yes — you're onto something structurally important here.

Lion doesn't just receive Owl's verdict and decide. Lion is the **convergence point** where everything comes together:

- **Eagle's map** → What is this conflict actually about? What are the friction points?
- **Bloodhound's data** → What actually happened? What do they say vs do vs want?
- **Owl's verdict** → What went wrong? Who's accountable for what?

And Lion asks: **Given all of that — what do we do?**

So Lion's first move isn't deciding. It's **recollection**:

> "What am I deciding on?"

This prevents the common failure: making a decision that addresses Owl's verdict but misses Eagle's map. You solve the symptom. The conflict returns.

---

**The sequence might be:**

1. **Lion recalls Eagle** — What was the conflict? (Not Owl's finding — Eagle's map)
2. **Lion recalls Owl** — What went wrong? What must be addressed?
3. **Lion asks** — What would resolve *both*? What passes L.E.R, B.U.S, A.C.T?
4. **Lion decides** — This is what I will do.

---
Lion is looking for solution but the first thing he needs is he needs to know what he needs to find a solution for:

1. List all decisions to aim at conflic solving to be made:
   
e.g. in an entrached family conflict this could be: 

Operational: Phone, Dentist, Therapist (Hair - but cna't be discussed)
Structural: Live with, Half-Terms, Section on Traveling
Other: Anything else? 
- communication - this a problem to be solved?
- him gaslighing/coershion - this is a problem to be solved?
- lack of ability to coordinate - this is a problem to be solved?
- If No to Half-terms swaps becuse father decides we needs time for Peace and Calm - so when that band ends, he decides on tnis? and that it ends when he comes to the mother for a half-term he would like? 









What JUDGMENT Evaluates
JUDGMENT identifies the gap between truth and what was presented, acted upon, or suppressed:
CategoryQuestionDeceptionWhat was lied about?ConcealmentWhat was hidden?NeglectWhat needs were ignored or dismissed?MistakesWhat errors were made?MiscommunicationWhat was misunderstood or poorly communicated?AccountabilityWho bears responsibility, and for what?

The Evaluation Process
For each sub-conflict, ask:

What should have happened? (Based on rules, agreements, reasonable expectations)
What actually happened? (Established in Stage 2)
Where is the gap?
What caused the gap? (Deception / Concealment / Neglect / Mistakes / Miscommunication)
Who is responsible?
What must be addressed before resolution is possible?


JUDGMENT — Fill in (per sub-conflict):
Sub-conflictWhat should have happenedWhat actually happenedThe gapCauseWho is responsibleWhat must be addressed

Stage 3 Output
At the end of Stage 3, you have:

✓ Violations identified (deception, concealment)
✓ Failures identified (neglect, mistakes, miscommunication)
✓ Unmet needs identified
✓ Accountability assigned (who is responsible for what)
✓ What must be addressed before resolution is possible


The Link to Stage 4
Stage 3 tells you what went wrong — the violations, failures, and accountability.


DECISION answers: Of what is possible, what do we choose to do?
DECISION is about resolving the conflict. How do we address the original conflict that we mapped in Stage 1?

## The Three Tests: Philosophical Foundation

The three tests are not arbitrary. They represent the three major traditions of ethical reasoning, ensuring comprehensive evaluation from multiple angles:

| Test | Philosophical Tradition | Domain | Core Question |
|------|------------------------|--------|---------------|
| **L.E.R** | Deontological (Kant, rules) | Permissibility in principle | Is it RIGHT? |
| **B.U.S** | Consequentialist (utility) | Prudence and effects | Is it WISE? |
| **A.C.T** | Pragmatic (feasibility) | Practical execution | Is it DOABLE? |

Together, these tests prevent common decision pitfalls: doing something legal but unwise, wise but impossible, or possible but wrong.

---

## Overview: The Three Tests

| Test | Name | Acronym | Question | Finds what's wrong with |
|------|------|---------|----------|------------------------|
| **1** | RIGHT | L.E.R | Is this RIGHT? | The PRINCIPLE |
| **2** | WISE | B.U.S | Is this WISE? | The OUTCOME |
| **3** | DOABLE | A.C.T | Is this DOABLE? | The EXECUTION |

---

## Test 1: RIGHT — Is this RIGHT?

### L.E.R TEST

**Aim:** To determine if the WANT is fundamentally LEGITIMATE and permissible in principle.

| Letter | Name | Function | Focus Question |
|--------|------|----------|----------------|
| **L** | LEGAL | Rules Check | Is the WANT ALLOWED by laws, regulations, contracts, or formal agreements? |
| **E** | ETHICAL | Morality Check | Is the WANT MORALLY RIGHT? (fair, safe, respectful, not harmful) |
| **R** | REVERSIBLE | Mirror Check | Would I accept this WANT if applied TO ME? (Verifies L and E) |

### The Mirror Check (R): Why It Matters

The Reversible test — "Would I accept this if applied to me?" — is the ultimate gut-check. It catches self-serving rationalisations that slip through abstract ethical reasoning. People can justify almost anything in the abstract, but when forced to imagine the same treatment applied to themselves, hypocrisy becomes visible.

This test operationalises what philosophers call the Golden Rule — one of the oldest and most universal ethical principles in human history.

### The Golden Rule: Universal Foundation

The principle of treating others as one would wish to be treated appears independently across virtually all human cultures and traditions:

- **Confucius (551–479 BCE):** "Do not do to others what you do not want them to do to you."
- **Buddhism:** "Hurt not others in ways that you yourself would find hurtful."
- **Judaism (Hillel):** "What is hateful to you, do not do to your fellow."
- **Christianity (Matthew 7:12):** "Do to others what you would have them do to you."
- **Islam:** "None of you truly believes until he loves for his brother what he loves for himself."

This near-universal presence suggests the principle arises from basic human empathy and the requirements of social cooperation. The Mirror Check harnesses this ancient wisdom as a practical test.

---

## Test 2: WISE — Is this WISE?

### B.U.S TEST

**Aim:** To determine if the WANT produces GOOD OUTCOMES across impact, scale, and time.

| Letter | Name | Function | Focus Question |
|--------|------|----------|----------------|
| **B** | BENEFIT | Impact Check | Who gains? Who loses? Is there net positive impact? |
| **U** | UNIVERSAL | Scale Check | Would the positive effects still hold if everyone adopted this WANT? |
| **S** | SUSTAINABLE | Duration Check | Do the positive effects last over time? |

This test evaluates consequences. Something can be legally permitted and ethically defensible in principle, yet still be unwise — producing more harm than benefit, working only if others don't do it, or creating short-term gains that collapse over time.

---

## Test 3: DOABLE — Is this DOABLE?

### A.C.T TEST

**Aim:** To determine if the WANT is FEASIBLE and can actually be executed.

| Letter | Name | Function | Focus Question |
|--------|------|----------|----------------|
| **A** | ASSETS | Resources Check | Are the necessary resources available? (money, time, people, tools) |
| **C** | CAPABILITY | Execution Check | Can the steps actually be carried out? (skills, process, authority) |
| **T** | TIMELY | Timing Check | Is it achievable within the required timeframe and current constraints? |

This test is purely practical. It does not judge whether the WANT is right or wise — only whether it can actually happen given current resources, capabilities, and constraints.

---

## The Decision Rule: Hierarchy of Tests

> **CRITICAL RULE**
>
> Reject any WANT that fails L.E.R or B.U.S, even if A.C.T passes.
>
> Only among WANTs that pass the first two tests should you use A.C.T to choose or plan implementation.

This hierarchy is essential. Without it, people justify wrong actions because they are easy. The tests must be applied in order:

1. **L.E.R first** — Is it RIGHT in principle?
2. **B.U.S second** — Is it WISE in outcomes?
3. **A.C.T last** — Is it DOABLE in practice?

A WANT that fails L.E.R or B.U.S is rejected — full stop. The fact that it passes A.C.T ("we can get away with it") is irrelevant. A.C.T only matters for WANTs that have already passed the first two tests.

---

## Worked Example: Phone Conflict

Two parents in a custody dispute disagree about phone parental controls. Each has a WANT. Let's test them.

### Father's WANT: Separate Control

*"I will set parental controls independently during my parenting time, without consulting Mother."*

| Test | Result | Reasoning |
|------|--------|-----------|
| **L (Legal)** | ✗ Fails | Violates court order (Schedule G) requiring joint decision-making |
| **E (Ethical)** | ✗ Fails | Unfair to child (inconsistent rules) and mother (excluded from decision) |
| **R (Reversible)** | ✗ Fails | Would father accept mother unilaterally overriding his decisions? No. |
| **B.U.S** | ✗ Fails | Child loses (inconsistency), not sustainable, not universal |
| **A.C.T** | ✓ Passes | Already happening — easy to execute |

**Verdict:** EASY but WRONG. Fails L.E.R and B.U.S. The fact that it passes A.C.T is irrelevant.

---

### Mother's WANT: Shared Control

*"We will agree on consistent parental controls that apply in both homes."*

| Test | Result | Reasoning |
|------|--------|-----------|
| **L (Legal)** | ✓ Passes | Complies with court order requiring joint decision-making |
| **E (Ethical)** | ✓ Passes | Fair to child (consistency) and both parents (equal input) |
| **R (Reversible)** | ✓ Passes | Mother would accept shared decision-making applied to her? Yes. |
| **B.U.S** | ✓ Passes | Child benefits, sustainable over time, works if universalised |
| **A.C.T** | ⚠ Partial | Requires father's cooperation — implementation barrier |

**Verdict:** RIGHT but HARD. Passes L.E.R and B.U.S. The partial A.C.T result tells us what's needed for implementation — not whether the WANT should be chosen.

---

### What the Tests Reveal

| Father's Position | Mother's Position |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Easy but WRONG** | **Right but HARD** |

The decision becomes clear: **The WANT that passes L.E.R and B.U.S should be chosen. A.C.T tells you what's needed to IMPLEMENT it.**

---

## Stage 3 Output

At the end of Stage 3, you have:

- ✓ Each candidate WANT tested against L.E.R (Right)
- ✓ Each candidate WANT tested against B.U.S (Wise)
- ✓ Each candidate WANT tested against A.C.T (Doable)
- ✓ Clear verdict: which WANTs pass, which fail, and why
- ✓ Implementation barriers identified (from A.C.T results)

---

## The Link to Stage 4

Stage 3 tells you what OUGHT to be — which WANTs are right and wise.

But knowing what ought to be is not the same as choosing to do it.

Stage 4 (Decision) takes the evaluated WANTs and asks: Given what is right and wise, what will you actually commit to doing? This is where judgment becomes intention.

---

## Full Pipeline Summary

> **MAP → TRUTH → JUDGMENT → DECISION → ACTION**
>
> *Name it → See it → Judge it → Choose it → Do it*

For Stage 3 specifically:

> **L.E.R → B.U.S → A.C.T → DECIDE**
>
> *"Is it Right? Is it Wise? Can we Act? Then Decide."*

---

## Working Template: Stage 3 Grid

Use this grid to evaluate each candidate WANT from Stage 2:

| WANT | L.E.R | B.U.S | A.C.T | Verdict |
|------|-------|-------|-------|---------|
| Party A's WANT | ✓ / ✗ / ⚠ | ✓ / ✗ / ⚠ | ✓ / ✗ / ⚠ | Pass / Fail / Notes |
| Party B's WANT | ✓ / ✗ / ⚠ | ✓ / ✗ / ⚠ | ✓ / ✗ / ⚠ | Pass / Fail / Notes |

**Remember:** A WANT must pass L.E.R AND B.U.S to be considered. A.C.T only determines implementation, not selection.

---

DECISION answers: Of what is possible, what do we choose to do?
DECISION is about resolving the conflict. How do we address the original conflict that we mapped in Stage 1?

## The Three Tests: Philosophical Foundation

The three tests are not arbitrary. They represent the three major traditions of ethical reasoning, ensuring comprehensive evaluation from multiple angles:

This near-universal presence suggests the principle arises from basic human empathy and the requirements of social cooperation. The Mirror Check harnesses this ancient wisdom as a practical test.

## Test 2: WISE — Is this WISE?

### B.U.S TEST

**Aim:** To determine if the WANT produces GOOD OUTCOMES across impact, scale, and time.

| Letter | Name | Function | Focus Question |
|--------|------|----------|----------------|
| **B** | BENEFIT | Impact Check | Who gains? Who loses? Is there net positive impact? |
| **U** | UNIVERSAL | Scale Check | Would the positive effects still hold if everyone adopted this WANT? |
| **S** | SUSTAINABLE | Duration Check | Do the positive effects last over time? |

This test evaluates consequences. Something can be legally permitted and ethically defensible in principle, yet still be unwise — producing more harm than benefit, working only if others don't do it, or creating short-term gains that collapse over time.

---

## Test 3: DOABLE — Is this DOABLE?

### A.C.T TEST

**Aim:** To determine if the WANT is FEASIBLE and can actually be executed.

| Letter | Name | Function | Focus Question |
|--------|------|----------|----------------|
| **A** | ASSETS | Resources Check | Are the necessary resources available? (money, time, people, tools) |
| **C** | CAPABILITY | Execution Check | Can the steps actually be carried out? (skills, process, authority) |
| **T** | TIMELY | Timing Check | Is it achievable within the required timeframe and current constraints? |

This test is purely practical. It does not judge whether the WANT is right or wise — only whether it can actually happen given current resources, capabilities, and constraints.

## The Decision Rule: Hierarchy of Tests

> **CRITICAL RULE**
>
> Reject any WANT that fails L.E.R or B.U.S, even if A.C.T passes.
>
> Only among WANTs that pass the first two tests should you use A.C.T to choose or plan implementation.

This hierarchy is essential. Without it, people justify wrong actions because they are easy. The tests must be applied in order:

1. **L.E.R first** — Is it RIGHT in principle?
2. **B.U.S second** — Is it WISE in outcomes?
3. **A.C.T last** — Is it DOABLE in practice?

A WANT that fails L.E.R or B.U.S is rejected — full stop. The fact that it passes A.C.T ("we can get away with it") is irrelevant. A.C.T only matters for WANTs that have already passed the first two tests.

## Worked Example: Phone Conflict

Two parents in a custody dispute disagree about phone parental controls. Each has a WANT. Let's test them.

### Father's WANT: Separate Control

*"I will set parental controls independently during my parenting time, without consulting Mother."*

| Test | Result | Reasoning |
|------|--------|-----------|
| **L (Legal)** | ✗ Fails | Violates court order (Schedule G) requiring joint decision-making |
| **E (Ethical)** | ✗ Fails | Unfair to child (inconsistent rules) and mother (excluded from decision) |
| **R (Reversible)** | ✗ Fails | Would father accept mother unilaterally overriding his decisions? No. |
| **B.U.S** | ✗ Fails | Child loses (inconsistency), not sustainable, not universal |
| **A.C.T** | ✓ Passes | Already happening — easy to execute |

**Verdict:** EASY but WRONG. Fails L.E.R and B.U.S. The fact that it passes A.C.T is irrelevant.

---

### Mother's WANT: Shared Control

*"We will agree on consistent parental controls that apply in both homes."*

| Test | Result | Reasoning |
|------|--------|-----------|
| **L (Legal)** | ✓ Passes | Complies with court order requiring joint decision-making |
| **E (Ethical)** | ✓ Passes | Fair to child (consistency) and both parents (equal input) |
| **R (Reversible)** | ✓ Passes | Mother would accept shared decision-making applied to her? Yes. |
| **B.U.S** | ✓ Passes | Child benefits, sustainable over time, works if universalised |
| **A.C.T** | ⚠ Partial | Requires father's cooperation — implementation barrier |

**Verdict:** RIGHT but HARD. Passes L.E.R and B.U.S. The partial A.C.T result tells us what's needed for implementation — not whether the WANT should be chosen.

---

### What the Tests Reveal

| Father's Position | Mother's Position |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Easy but WRONG** | **Right but HARD** |

The decision becomes clear: **The WANT that passes L.E.R and B.U.S should be chosen. A.C.T tells you what's needed to IMPLEMENT it.**

---

## Stage 3 Output

At the end of Stage 3, you have:

- ✓ Each candidate WANT tested against L.E.R (Right)
- ✓ Each candidate WANT tested against B.U.S (Wise)
- ✓ Each candidate WANT tested against A.C.T (Doable)
- ✓ Clear verdict: which WANTs pass, which fail, and why
- ✓ Implementation barriers identified (from A.C.T results)

---

## The Link to Stage 4

Stage 3 tells you what OUGHT to be — which WANTs are right and wise.

But knowing what ought to be is not the same as choosing to do it.

Stage 4 (Decision) takes the evaluated WANTs and asks: Given what is right and wise, what will you actually commit to doing? This is where judgment becomes intention.

## Full Pipeline Summary

> **MAP → TRUTH → JUDGMENT → DECISION → ACTION**
>
> *Name it → See it → Judge it → Choose it → Do it*

For Stage 3 specifically:

> **L.E.R → B.U.S → A.C.T → DECIDE**
>
> *"Is it Right? Is it Wise? Can we Act? Then Decide."*

## Working Template: Stage 3 Grid

Use this grid to evaluate each candidate WANT from Stage 2:

| WANT | L.E.R | B.U.S | A.C.T | Verdict |
|------|-------|-------|-------|---------|
| Party A's WANT | ✓ / ✗ / ⚠ | ✓ / ✗ / ⚠ | ✓ / ✗ / ⚠ | Pass / Fail / Notes |
| Party B's WANT | ✓ / ✗ / ⚠ | ✓ / ✗ / ⚠ | ✓ / ✗ / ⚠ | Pass / Fail / Notes |

**Remember:** A WANT must pass L.E.R AND B.U.S to be considered. A.C.T only determines implementation, not selection.
