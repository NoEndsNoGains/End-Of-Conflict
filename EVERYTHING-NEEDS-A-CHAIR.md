## Pre-Flight Check — "Let me be Tender"
Everyone seat down

The framework asks you to be ice-cold. Indifferent. Distant from your own position.

This is not possible while anything is running you.

This is your pre-flight check. You don't take off until everything that wants the steering wheel has been seated. Not suppressed. Not ignored. Seated.

You cannot fly a plane full of unseated passengers running up and down the aisles. You aren't asking them to get off — you need them for the journey. But they must be buckled in. You need the weight distributed. You need the cabin quiet so you can hear the instruments.

---

They wronged you. That's real. The question is: how long do you want to carry it?
You can choose to say the thing. But first ask: Does it need to be said? Am I the one to say it? Is this the right time? Will saying it change anything — or just relieve me?
To stand up for yourself, you first need to learn who's worth getting out of your chair for.
----

### I. What's Flooding You *(Biology/Psychology)*

**A) The Emotions**

Give them a chair.

The emotions may be enormous: rage, anger, disappointment, frustration, hopelessness, resignation, despair. You might be deathly afraid of the conflict you are in. They belong. They are telling you something matters.

That does not mean your emotions are wrong. It does not mean the conflict doesn't deserve them. It does not mean something is broken in you.

But the emotions are there trying to help you "win" — to get what you need, to protect you, to end the threat. They have already decided the verdict. They have skipped the steps. And when you are inside it — flooded, afraid, running — it is incomprehensible. You cannot grasp where you are. You cannot see which stage you're in. You are everywhere and nowhere at once.

Forcing neutrality while flooded is not stepping back — it's lying to yourself.

*Fuck that. I just want to win.*

Of course you do. Winning might be survival. Winning might be justice. Winning might be the only way your kids are safe. The framework is not asking you to stop wanting that.

But right now — flooded, afraid, reactive — you cannot win. You don't know where you are. You don't know what move comes next. You are swinging blind.

The framework offers something different: ground to stand on. Not control over the outcome — control over the process. You can say: "I know where I am. I know what step comes next. I am confident in *this*, even when I cannot control *that*."

That is not giving up on winning. That is how you stop losing by accident.

You cannot see clearly while they are running you. Sometimes the conflict deserves that you don't do the framework yet. Sometimes what must be honoured first is that these emotions are present. That comes before sight.

**B) The Body**

Give it a chair.

Flooding isn't just emotional. The racing heart, the tight throat, the clenched jaw, the shaking hands — the nervous system has its own grip. Your body decided this was danger before your mind had a word for it. If the body is screaming, the mind cannot be ice-cold.

**C) The Instinct**

Give it a chair.

The animal response that arrives before thought. Fight. Flight. Freeze. It doesn't negotiate. It doesn't sequence. It survives.

**D) The Exhaustion**

Give it a chair.

Not the Void — not the fear of emptiness. Just the depletion. The part that says: *I can't do this anymore. I'm too tired to see clearly. I'm too tired to fight. I'm too tired to care.* Tiredness has its own blindness. Sometimes the most honest thing you can say is: "I am too tired to be smart right now."

---

### II. What's Driving You *(Psychology/Identity)*

**E) The Ego**

Give it a chair.

The part that needs to be right. To win. To not look foolish. The Ego is terrified of being wrong, of losing status, of being seen as weak. It will hijack the framework to prove it was right all along.

**F) The Verdict You've Already Reached**

Give it a chair.

The conclusion you arrived at before doing the work. The case is closed. You're just looking for evidence now. This isn't sight — it's confirmation.

**G) The Stories**

Give them a chair.

The narratives from the Prologue. The wounded-wounding story. The clean-hands story. The being-right story. They have already written the script. The framework is just a new costume for the same play.

**H) Your Position**

Give it a chair.

Your stake. Your side. Your "I." The place you're standing that you cannot see because you're standing in it.

---

### III. What's Protecting You *(Defence Systems)*

**I) The Shadows**

Give them a chair.

What you don't want to see about yourself. The parts you'd rather not acknowledge. The ways you are also the thing you're fighting against.

**J) The Protector**

Give it a chair.

The part scanning for threat. Keeping you safe by keeping you closed. The Protector invented the Ego and the Stories. It only sits when it trusts the framework is a better weapon than rage.

**K) The Fixer**

Give it a chair.

Distinct from the Protector. The Protector scans for threat. The Fixer can't stand stillness. It wants to skip to the end. It thinks if it doesn't act *right now*, everything will fall apart. It's about tempo — the unbearable pressure of waiting.

**L) The Need for Certainty**

Give it a chair.

The part that can't tolerate not knowing how this ends. It hates the framework because the framework is messy and the outcome is unknown. It wants guarantees before it will begin.

---

### IV. What's Haunting You *(Time/Relational)*

**M) The Ghost of the Other**

Give it a chair.

Sometimes the driver isn't even you. It's their voice in your head — your mother, your ex, the person you're in conflict with. You are reacting to them inside your own mind. They are driving your car from the passenger seat.

**N) The Past**

Give it a chair.

The weight of what happened. It keeps arriving. Every time you think you've moved forward, it pulls you back. The past has its own gravity.

**O) The Future**

Give it a chair.

The fear or hope of what might happen. It pulls you forward before you've seen where you are. You're already living in a tomorrow that hasn't arrived.

---

### V. What's Binding You *(Social/Cultural)*

**P) The Tribe**

Give it a chair.

What your people expect. The fear that stepping back means betraying them. That seeing clearly is disloyalty. That peace is treason.

**Q) The Audience**

Give it a chair.

Who's watching. How you'll be judged. The performance of the conflict for those who are not in it.

**R) The Honour / The Shame**

Give them a chair.

What your culture says you must defend. What your culture says you must hide. The rules you didn't write but still obey.

**S) The Inheritance**

Give it a chair.

How you were taught to fight. Your family's script. Your ancestors' wars. The feud that became gravity. The patterns you repeat without knowing you're repeating them.

---

### VI. What's Calculating *(Economic/Strategic)*

**T) The Sunk Cost**

Give it a chair.

What you've already invested. Walking away means it was all for nothing. The years. The money. The suffering. You stay because leaving would make it meaningless.

**U) The Leverage**

Give it a chair.

What you gain by staying in conflict. The power it gives you. The position it protects. The advantage you'd lose if this ended.

**V) The Status**

Give it a chair.

What you lose by backing down. The rank. The reputation. The face.

**W) The Martyr**

Give it a chair.

The ledger-keeper. The one who remembers every time you were kind and they weren't. Every sacrifice. Every effort. Every "I tried." The heavy bags of what you are owed. The Martyr uses your goodness as a shield — and as a weapon. It reframes victimhood as currency. You've saved up so much moral high ground that you don't want to spend it by resolving the issue.

---

### VII. What's Holding the Whole Thing Together *(Systemic/Existential)*

**X) The System**

Give it a chair.

The larger pattern that *needs* your conflict to continue. The function the conflict serves — stability, scapegoat, distraction. You are a cog. The machine wants you to keep turning.

**Y) The Identity**

Give it a chair.

Who are you if not the one who was wronged? If a Montague stops hating Capulets, he loses the fire that kept him warm for forty years. He has to face the emptiness: *Who am I if I am not the man who was wronged?*

**Z) The Meaning**

Give it a chair.

What the conflict gives your life. Purpose. Direction. An enemy. A reason to get up. Without it — what are you fighting for?

**AA) The Hope**

Give it a chair.

The quiet one. It hides behind the Fixer or the Ego. It is still waiting for the miracle. The belief that if you just wait a little longer, or say the perfect thing, they will suddenly wake up, apologise, and become the person you need them to be. It is the refusal to accept reality as it is. Not the Future — which is general fear or hope — but a specific, stubborn attachment to a version of the other that does not exist. A small child holding a broken toy, staring at the door.

**BB) The Void**

Give it a chair.

The emptiness that waits if the conflict ends. The terror of peace. The Void is not flooding you, driving you, protecting you, haunting you, or binding you. It's what waits *after*. The silence. The question: who am I without this fight?

---

### VIII. The Uninvited Guest

**CC) ?**

What did I miss? Who else is in the room? Who's hiding behind the curtains? Who's whispering that this won't work?

This list is not complete. It cannot be. You know your room better than I do.

---

## When You're Ready

This is what I tell my daughters — especially the younger one — when something is troubling them.

Whatever it is — emotion, ego, story, verdict, position, shadow, ghost, ledger, hope, void — imagine it as a creature. Anger might be a pufferfish, spiky and puffed. Grief might be something heavy and slow. The Ego might be a peacock too tired to hold its feathers up. The Martyr might be a pack-mule bent under too many bags. The Hope might be a small child at the door, still waiting. It doesn't matter what shape.

Now: create for each creature the most comfortable chair you can imagine. Shaped exactly for them. Soft where they need soft. Steady where they need steady. A rocking chair for the one who needs motion. A throne for the one who needs dignity. A nest for the one who needs warmth.

You are not sending them away. You are not suppressing them. You are containing them — giving them a place to rest, in full view, while you do the work.

They sit. You see.

When the work is done, they are still there. Honoured. Not abandoned.

You don't have to kill your feelings. You just have to give them a safe place to sit so they don't block your view.

The ice-cold distance of the framework is not the absence of these things. It is the silence that happens when they are all, finally, comfortable enough to stop shouting.

A Hopi Elder Speaks
Attributed to the Elders, Oraibi, Arizona, Hopi Nation — June 8, 2000

"You have been telling the people that this is the Eleventh Hour, now you must go back and tell the people that this is the Hour. And there are things to be considered...
Where are you living?
What are you doing?
What are your relationships?
Are you in right relation?
Where is your water?
Know your garden.
It is time to speak your Truth.
Create your community.
Be good to each other.
And do not look outside yourself for the leader."
Then he clasped his hands together, smiled, and said, "This could be a good time!"
"There is a river flowing now very fast. It is so great and swift that there are those who will be afraid. They will try to hold on to the shore. They will feel they are torn apart and will suffer greatly.
"Know the river has its destination. The elders say we must let go of the shore, push off into the middle of the river, keep our eyes open, and our heads above water. And I say, see who is in there with you and celebrate. At this time in history, we are to take nothing personally. Least of all ourselves. For the moment that we do, our spiritual growth and journey comes to a halt.
"The time for the lone wolf is over.
Gather yourselves!
Banish the word struggle from your attitude and your vocabulary.
All that we do now must be done in a sacred manner and in celebration.
"We are the ones we've been waiting for."

— The Elders, Oraibi, Arizona, Hopi Nation







**The most dangerous combinations:**

Not any single passenger — but when they *lock together* into a system that can't be unlocked from the inside.

---

**The Unholy Trinity: Identity + Void + Tribe**

| Passenger | What it does |
|-----------|--------------|
| Identity | Who you are depends on the conflict continuing |
| Void | You fear what waits if the conflict ends |
| Tribe | Your people expect you to fight; peace is betrayal |

This is the trap with no exit. If you step back, you lose yourself, face emptiness, AND betray your people. The framework becomes *literally unthinkable* — not refused, but invisible.

---

**The Sealed Case: Verdict + Protector + Martyr**

| Passenger | What it does |
|-----------|--------------|
| Verdict | You've already decided who's guilty |
| Protector | Your defences won't let new information in |
| Martyr | Your ledger of suffering justifies everything |

The framework can't penetrate. Every question bounces off. "I already know. I've suffered enough to know. And I won't let you trick me."

---

**The Frozen Wait: Hope + Sunk Cost + Exhaustion**

| Passenger | What it does |
|-----------|--------------|
| Hope | Still waiting for them to change |
| Sunk Cost | Too much invested to walk away |
| Exhaustion | Too tired to see, fight, or move |

Limbo. Not fighting, not resolving. Just waiting. Depleted. Unable to act because acting means admitting the Hope was false and the Cost was wasted.

---

**The Inherited War: System + Inheritance + Honour**

| Passenger | What it does |
|-----------|--------------|
| System | The larger structure needs your conflict |
| Inheritance | You didn't start this — you were born into it |
| Honour | Your culture demands you continue |

You're not even the protagonist of your own war. You're a relay runner carrying a baton you never chose. Dropping it shames your ancestors.

---

**On the Israel-Gaza example:**

This is exactly where the framework proves itself — or fails.

If the passengers are *human*, they should appear on both sides. Not because the situation is symmetric — it isn't — but because *people* are symmetric. Both sides have:

| Passenger | Israeli version | Palestinian version |
|-----------|-----------------|---------------------|
| **Inheritance** | The Shoah. "Never again." Generational trauma that says: weakness = death | The Nakba. "We will return." Generational dispossession that says: forgetting = erasure |
| **Tribe** | Jewish survival. The diaspora watching. "The world abandoned us before." | Palestinian solidarity. The Arab world watching. "No one else will fight for us." |
| **Identity** | "We built this from nothing. We have nowhere else." | "This is our land. We have nowhere else." |
| **Honour** | Military culture. Deterrence. "If we show weakness, they'll destroy us." | Resistance culture. Sumud (steadfastness). "If we submit, we disappear." |
| **System** | Political factions that need the conflict. Security apparatus. Settlement economy. | Political factions that need the conflict. Resistance as governance. Martyr economy. |
| **Hope** | "Maybe this operation will finally bring peace." | "Maybe this resistance will finally bring justice." |
| **Void** | Who are we without the threat? What holds us together without an enemy? | Who are we without the struggle? What is Palestinian identity without resistance? |
| **Martyr** | "Look what they did to us. October 7th. The buses. The rockets." | "Look what they did to us. 1948. The checkpoints. The children." |
| **Ghost** | The terrorist in the tunnel. The knife in the crowd. | The soldier at the door. The drone in the sky. |

---

**The test:**

This is self-assessment could work. Not "score yourself 1-10" — that lets people lie. But something like:

> Read each statement. If it makes you defensive, that passenger is driving.

For example:

- "What if you're partly wrong?" → If rage: **Verdict**
- "What do you gain by staying in this conflict?" → If denial: **Leverage / Status**
- "Who would you be if this ended tomorrow?" → If terror: **Identity / Void**
- "What would your family say if you walked away?" → If shame: **Tribe / Honour**
- "What are you too tired to admit?" → If collapse: **Exhaustion**
- "Are you still waiting for them to change?" → If grief: **Hope**

---

**What this section could become:**

1. **The Combinations** — Name the most dangerous locks (as above)
2. **The Mirror Test** — Questions that reveal which passengers are driving (by what triggers defensiveness)
3. **The Applied Example** — Israel/Gaza as illustration that the passengers are *human*, not partisan

---

How explicit to be on  the Israel/Gaza example to be? It could be:

- **Full parallel table** (as above) — powerful but risky
- **Referenced but not detailed** — "Consider any intractable conflict — the same passengers appear on both sides"
- **Placed in a separate 'Stress Test' section** — where you apply the framework to hard cases
