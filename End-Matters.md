All wrong - I don't even know what I want to say any more just that I am tired. 

Chapter 9: Hope

regardwlas who yiu are there ia onw think unites u- you reached out up to here as for whatever reason you needed it - you hooe to get a bit closer to how to reaolvw tje conflucts that cant be resolved I think there are two options of why you're reading this book:

Option A: You believe that there is still hope - hope to do something about this - this meaning this complex, layered, prolonged, unsolvable conflict.
Option B: You're looking for another proof that there is no point and there is no hope - no framework, however good, can solve these types of conflicts.


   This book can be easly used as the evidence of any of the above.

Option A: is a nice. There is still energy, willginess, all nice things do when there is hope. 
But Option B: not so nice: 

But you see: what if I tell you, neigher of these positions are the point that this book actully make?
   

   
This is the first and the last chapter of this book.
These are the exact words you read here and the exact words you will find at the end.
What is the point of the same words here and there?
No point.
No hope.
And that is where this book finishes for you.
The end of a book on conflicts so devastating, so complex, so unsolvable there is no point in even trying. Why would you try if there is no point?
No point. No hope.
You can "try" - trying requires action. Some action. Any action. But why would you act, why would you do anything, if there is no point?
No point. No hope.
In place of no hope, everything is too much. There is too much no point to even try. It's like trying knowing you will arrive exactly where you started.
And that is where this book starts for you.
No point. No hope.
You either stay or you go.
But when there is no point and no hope, you do not go. You stay.
Nothing wrong with staying: finally, a bit of peace. A second of completely perfect undisturbed resignation. You, waiting to be shot. You are out by definition.
Because if there is no point and no hope, you cannot go. How can you go?
There is no clever argument that can move you from that place. No smart word. No reframe, no technique, no five-step process. In that place, there is nothing. No way out.
I cannot make you go. I wouldn't insult you by trying.
I cannot even tell you to find the edges of no hope. That would still be asking you to move.
So I will say only this:
No hope. No point.
Who said?
You did.
You made that judgment. You drew that line. You looked at your conflict, your situation, your life, and you concluded: no hope, no point.
That conclusion felt like discovering a fact. Like finding a wall. But it was not a discovery. It was a decision. Yours.
If you built it, it has edges. The edges you drew.
You do not have to find them. You do not have to look. The edge finds you. It comes to you like gravity. No effort needed. You just fall toward it. And maybe the falling teaches you how to land.
It's not even sad, this. It's simple. Like watching rain from inside. You don't have to understand why it's falling. Just that it is.
The gift is not hope. The gift is noticing that the blueprint was yours all along. The pencil marks are yours. You can erase. You can redraw. You can leave the cage empty - just a shape, not a sentence.
And if this feels stupid. If this feels like just another pointless thing someone is telling you.
Don't move.
Stay in the place. Don't try to understand. Don't try to use this. Don't try.
Just be there.
Because even not moving - even staying completely still inside what you built - you are still inside a shape. A shape you made.
And shapes have edges.
The edge will find you.
You don't have to go to it.
Which might be the whole point.
