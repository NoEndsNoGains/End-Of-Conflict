# You're Not a Betta Fish 

## A Five-Stage Framework to End Hopeless Conflict

<img width="1024" height="1024" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3b8e02e7-1d42-463e-ad8e-224df2bc14d9" />


_Summary (Back Cover):_

A systematic framework that transforms intractable conflicts into solvable problems by separating what happened from what to do about it.

Most conflicts persist not because they're unsolvable, but because we skip the steps resolution requires: we don't name them clearly, we assume instead of verify, we judge people instead of consequences, we confuse the verdict with the sentence, and we talk without acting. This book offers a five-stage diagnostic framework—Map, Reality, Judgment, Decision, Action—that forces the precision conflicts demand but emotions prevent.

Simple. Straightforward. Practical. Picture- based. Tables. Definitions. Checklists. "What to do." "Why." "Fill in."
The framework is about devastating, stuck, hopeless conflict. The writing reads like a compliance manual.

And yet, a framework that still manages to turn everything on its head. A book that goes on a deep dive of what is obvious and never talked about. 

We learn that underneath the five stages lies an engine room: a Truth Tester that reveals we can only resolve what we capture—but what we capture is always imperfect, unwhole, and surrounded by the shaped silence of what wasn't; a Living Research Protocol that breaks every claim on purpose, because transformation happens through breaking ("I thought X, actually Y")—making the framework and each of its claims not only unfinished but continuously changing; and an Immunity Paradox that reveals why we fail at three levels—mapping symptoms instead of triggers, responding with blunt instruments, and forgetting everything the moment the ceasefire is signed.

The framework doesn't promise magic. It promises the best of what's possible—and shows you exactly where that boundary lies.


_Prologue_

**Foreword: Beautiful, Dramatic, Tragic**

We, you, I—aren't we beautiful, dramatic, and tragic all at once?

A bit like the betta fish.

Stunning creature. Iridescent. Fins like silk. Put a mirror in the tank and it attacks. Flares and exhausts itself against an enemy that isn't there. It's fighting a projection. Not reality.

It can do this until it dies.

In conflict, we're betta fish. Fighting our own reflection. Exhausting ourselves against glass.

This book won't make you peaceful. Some conflicts are real. Some enemies aren't reflections.

But most of the time? We're attacking the mirror.

This framework is how you check.

## OVERVIEW

# End of Conflict

## A Five-Stage Framework for Resolving the Unresolvable

A systematic framework that transforms intractable conflicts into solvable problems by separating what happened from what to do about it.

Most conflicts persist not because they're unsolvable, but because we skip the steps resolution requires: we don't name them clearly, we assume instead of verify, we judge people instead of consequences, we confuse the verdict with the sentence, and we talk without acting. This book offers a five-stage diagnostic framework—Map, Reality, Judgment, Decision, Action—that forces the precision conflicts demand but emotions prevent.

Simple. Straightforward. Practical. And yet, a framework that still manages to turn everything on its head.

We learn that underneath the five stages lies an engine room: a Truth Tester that reveals we can only resolve what we capture—but what we capture is always imperfect, unwhole, and surrounded by the shaped silence of what wasn't; a Living Research Protocol that breaks every claim on purpose, because transformation happens through breaking ("I thought X, actually Y")—making the framework and each of its claims not only unfinished but continuously changing; and an Immunity Paradox that reveals why we fail at three levels—mapping symptoms instead of triggers, responding with blunt instruments, and forgetting everything the moment the ceasefire is signed.

The framework doesn't promise magic. It promises the best of what's possible—and shows you exactly where that boundary lies.

# PART 1: OVERVIEW

## End of Conflict Cheat Sheet

*[PLACEHOLDER: Visual one-page summary of the entire framework - the five stages, the core principle, the three consequences, and key tests. To be designed as a reference page readers can return to.]*

---

## 1.1 What is this?

The End of Conflict Framework is a systematic process for resolving conflicts that seem intractable. It applies to disputes between people, groups, or institutions, and to internal dilemmas within one person (modelled as competing "parties"). The framework forces precision at each stage, preventing the drift that causes most conflict resolution efforts to fail.

---

## 1.2 Core Principle

**Name it → Know it → Judge it → Choose it → Do it.**

---

## 1.3 The Journey

Map → Reality → Judgment → Decision → Action

---

## 1.4 The Five Stages

| Stage | Activity | Output | Question | What you get | Medical Analogy | Role |
|-------|----------|--------|----------|--------------|-----------------|------|
| **Map** | Name it | Boundary | Who is involved? What is the territory? | Who fights over what | Presenting Problem | The Case |
| **Reality** | Know it | Clashes | What does each party say, do, want? Where do they clash? | The frictions between versions | Symptoms | The Cause |
| **Judgment** | Judge it | Consequences | What is the cost? What has been Violated, Concealed, Ignored? | The cost—Violated, Concealed, Ignored | Diagnosis | The Effect |
| **Decision** | Choose it | Resolution | What path forward addresses the consequences? | The path to resolve the conflict | Treatment | The Cure |
| **Action** | Do it | Change | What will make it real? | Implemented steps, owners, timelines | Recovery | The Recovery |

---

## 1.5 The Chain: Case → Cause → Effect → Cure → Recovery

| Stage | Role | Example |
|-------|------|---------|
| **Map** | The Case | "This is the conflict we are examining." |
| **Reality** | The Cause | "We have a clash between Person A's Want and Person B's Do." |
| **Judgment** | The Effect | "Because of this clash, trust is Violated, progress is Stalled, morale is Ignored." |
| **Decision** | The Cure | "To address these consequences, we must do X, Y, and Z." |
| **Action** | The Recovery | "These are the steps, owners, and timelines to make it real." |

---

## 1.6 The Three Consequences (Violated, Concealed, Ignored)

Judgment is an **Audit of Gaps** — the distance between what is and what should be.

| Consequence | What it captures | Examples |
|-------------|------------------|----------|
| **Violated** | What was broken | Rules, agreements, trust, integrity breached |
| **Concealed** | What was hidden | Facts, motives, truth withheld |
| **Ignored** | What was missed | Needs, fears, wants, losses unacknowledged |

**Note:** These are **lenses**, not boxes. They can overlap. Something can be both Concealed AND Ignored. You evaluate through all three.

This covers: **Accountability** (Violated), **Transparency** (Concealed), **Healing** (Ignored).

*You are not judging the person. You are judging the impact of the friction.*

---

## 1.7 Why Consequences Not People (Verdict vs Sentence)

*[PLACEHOLDER: This section needs to be written. Key content to develop:]*

- *The distinction between judging a person versus judging the impact of their actions*
- *Why this distinction matters for sustainable resolution*
- *The Verdict vs Sentence distinction: Judgment determines what happened and its cost (the verdict); Decision determines what to do about it (the sentence)*
- *How conflating these leads to premature conclusions and escalation*
- *Link to the depersonalisation principle in 1.8*

---

## 1.8 Why This Works

- **Depersonalised** — You judge the impact, not the person
- **Scales** — Hurt feelings or lost revenue, same framework
- **Forces precision** — No consequences, no real conflict
- **Iterates** — Action closes the loop, or reveals the map was incomplete and the cycle begins again

---

## 1.9 The Final Test

Judgment asks: **"What is the cost of this conflict?"**

If you can't name a consequence (a Violation, a Concealment, or an Ignored need), there might not be a conflict worth resolving through this framework — or you haven't looked hard enough.

But if there is a cost, that cost dictates the Decision.

---

## 1.10 The Value Function

The framework is called "End of Conflict." The purpose is to **end conflict** in a way that:

- Is **sustainable** (doesn't reignite)
- **Serves all parties** (or as many as possible)
- Is **fair** (L.E.R tests: Legal, Ethical, Reversible)
- Is **wise** (B.U.S tests: Benefit, Universal, Sustainable)
- Is **doable** (A.C.T tests: Assets, Capability, Timely)

**The value function:** Resolve conflict sustainably and fairly.

It's not purely Pareto (someone may have to lose). Not purely rights-based (though L.E.R includes rights). Not purely restorative (though it can be).

***It's pragmatic resolution with ethical constraints.***

---

# PART 2: THE FRAMEWORK

## 2.1 Constraints

### Pre-Check: Does This Situation Fit?

Not every frustration is a conflict. Before using this framework, confirm the situation qualifies.

### When to Use This Framework

Use when **all** of the following are true:

1. There are at least two positions in genuine disagreement.
2. Each position is held by someone (or some group) who can choose and act.
3. You can state what the conflict is about in one sentence.
4. You know enough about the situation to sketch an initial map.

### When NOT to Use This Framework

Do **not** use when:

1. There is only frustration, not a second position. ("I hate the traffic" is not a conflict — traffic cannot negotiate.)
2. The "other side" is a force of nature or the irreversible past. (No agent can respond.)
3. You cannot yet say what the fight is about. (You need more information before mapping.)

### How to Begin

1. **Locate yourself.** Are you an observer, a party, or dealing with an internal conflict? Is this past, present, or future? (See Section 2.2.)
2. **Write your one-sentence conflict name.** "This is a conflict about …"
3. **Draft a first map.** List parties, their positions, and what each stands to gain or lose.
4. **Proceed through the stages.** Map → Reality → Judgment → Decision → Action.

---

## 2.2 Before You Begin: Locate Yourself

Before you start Stage 1 (Map), you must locate yourself relative to the conflict. Two dimensions set your coordinates.

### Dimension 1: Position — What is your relationship to the conflict?

This determines whether you can affect the outcome, what blind spots to expect, and how hard it will be to see clearly.

| Position | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Observer** | You have no power to affect the outcome. You are analysing only. |
| **Party** | You have power to affect the outcome — whether as someone *in* the conflict, or someone with authority *over* it. |
| **Internal** | The conflict is within yourself. You are analyst, all parties, and the battlefield. |

**What counts as a "party"?**

A party is anyone with power to change what happens: the people *in* the conflict (they can escalate, concede, act); a judge (they can decide); a parent mediating between children (they can intervene); a boss resolving a team dispute (they can impose).

**What counts as an "observer"?**

An observer has no power over the outcome: a historian analysing a past war (it is over); a journalist reporting on a dispute (can observe, cannot decide); you analysing someone else's conflict with no involvement (just watching).

**Note on internal conflicts:**

Internal conflicts require stepping outside yourself to see your competing forces as if they were separate parties. This is the hardest application. Internal conflicts rarely stay internal — you must also identify who else is affected.

### Dimension 2: Time — When is the conflict?

This determines what counts as evidence, whether action is possible, and whether your map is real or hypothetical.

| Time | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Past** | Already happened. Memory, documents, evidence. You know how it ended. |
| **Present** | Happening now. Real events, real claims, real parties. |
| **Future** | Has not played out yet. Projections, assumptions, scenarios. You are preparing. |

**Note on future mode:**

Your map is a hypothesis. You are simulating, not resolving. Until the conflict plays out, your map is incomplete. Simulation is preparation, not resolution.

### What Each Combination Allows

| Time | Map | Reality | Judgment | Decision | Action |
|------|-----|---------|----------|----------|--------|
| **Past** | You can map | Verify against evidence | Judge with hindsight | Already decided | Already acted — learn |
| **Present** | You can map | Verify against reality | You can judge | You can decide | You can act |
| **Future** | You can map | Guessing — projections | You are preparing | You are rehearsing | Not yet — simulation |

### Summary: The Pre-Check

| Question | Dimension | What it determines |
|----------|-----------|-------------------|
| What is my relationship to this conflict? | Position | Whether you can affect the outcome. Your blind spots. How hard it will be to see. |
| When is this conflict? | Time | What counts as evidence. Whether action is possible. Whether your map is real or hypothetical. |

***Before you map the conflict, you map your position relative to it.***

# End of Conflict

A five-stage framework for analysing and resolving conflicts — external disputes or internal dilemmas.

---

## 1. Overview

### 1.1 What is this?

The End of Conflict Framework is a systematic process for resolving conflicts that seem intractable. It applies to disputes between people, groups, or institutions, and to internal dilemmas within one person (modelled as competing "parties"). The framework forces precision at each stage, preventing the drift that causes most conflict resolution efforts to fail.

### 1.2 Core Principle

**Name it → Know it → Judge it → Choose it → Do it.**

### 1.3 The Journey

```
Map → Reality → Judgment → Decision → Action
```

### 1.4 The Five Stages

| Stage | Activity | Output | Question | What you get | Functional Logic | Medical Analogy | Role |
|-------|----------|--------|----------|--------------|------------------|-----------------|------|
| **Map** | Name it | Boundary | Who is involved? What is the territory of the fight? | Who fights over what | Defining the Scope | Presenting Problem | The Case |
| **Reality** | Know it | Clashes | What does each party say, do, want? Where do they clash? | The frictions between versions | The Data | Symptoms | The Cause |
| **Judgment** | Judge it | Consequences | What is the cost? What has been Violated, Concealed, Ignored? | The cost — Violated, Concealed, Ignored | The Damage Report | Diagnosis | The Effect |
| **Decision** | Choose it | Resolution | What path forward addresses the consequences? | The path to resolve the conflict | The Strategy | Treatment | The Cure |
| **Action** | Do it | Change | What will make it real? | Implemented steps, owners, timelines | The Implementation | Recovery | The Recovery |

### 1.5 The Chain: Case → Cause → Effect → Cure → Recovery

| Stage | Role | Example |
|-------|------|---------|
| **Map** | The Case | "This is the conflict we are examining." |
| **Reality** | The Cause | "We have a clash between Person A's Want and Person B's Do." |
| **Judgment** | The Effect | "Because of this clash, trust is Violated, progress is Stalled, morale is Ignored." |
| **Decision** | The Cure | "To address these consequences, we must do X, Y, and Z." |
| **Action** | The Recovery | "These are the steps, owners, and timelines to make it real." |

### 1.6 The Three Consequences

Judgment is an **Audit of Gaps** — the distance between what is and what should be.

| Consequence | What it captures | Examples |
|-------------|------------------|----------|
| **Violated** | What was broken | Rules, agreements, trust, integrity breached |
| **Concealed** | What was hidden | Facts, motives, truth withheld |
| **Ignored** | What was missed | Needs, fears, wants, losses unacknowledged |

**Note:** These are **lenses**, not boxes. They can overlap. Something can be both Concealed AND Ignored. You evaluate through all three.

This covers:
- **Accountability** (Violated)
- **Transparency** (Concealed)
- **Healing** (Ignored)

You are not judging the person. You are judging the impact of the friction.

### 1.7 Why This Works

- **Depersonalised** — You judge the impact, not the person
- **Scales** — Hurt feelings or lost revenue, same framework
- **Forces precision** — No consequences, no real conflict
- **Iterates** — Action closes the loop, or reveals the map was incomplete and the cycle begins again

### 1.8 The Final Test

Judgment asks: **"What is the cost of this conflict?"**

If you can't name a consequence (a Violation, a Concealment, or an Ignored need), there might not be a conflict worth resolving through this framework — or you haven't looked hard enough.

But if there is a cost, that cost dictates the Decision.

### 1.9 The Value Function

The framework is called "End of Conflict." The purpose is to **end conflict** in a way that:

- Is **sustainable** (doesn't reignite)
- **Serves all parties** (or as many as possible)
- Is **fair** (L.E.R tests: Legal, Ethical, Reversible)
- Is **wise** (B.U.S tests: Benefit, Universal, Sustainable)
- Is **doable** (A.C.T tests: Assets, Capability, Timely)

**The value function:** Resolve conflict sustainably and fairly.

It's not purely Pareto (someone may have to lose). Not purely rights-based (though L.E.R includes rights). Not purely restorative (though it can be).

It's **pragmatic resolution with ethical constraints.**

---

## 2. Constraints

### 2.1 Pre-Check: Does This Situation Fit?

Not every frustration is a conflict. Before using this framework, confirm the situation qualifies.

### 2.2 When to Use This Framework

Use when **all** of the following are true:

1. There are at least two positions in genuine disagreement.
2. Each position is held by someone (or some group) who can choose and act.
3. You can state what the conflict is about in one sentence.
4. You know enough about the situation to sketch an initial map.

### 2.3 When NOT to Use This Framework

Do **not** use when:

1. There is only frustration, not a second position. ("I hate the traffic" is not a conflict — traffic cannot negotiate.)
2. The "other side" is a force of nature or the irreversible past. (No agent can respond.)
3. You cannot yet say what the fight is about. (You need more information before mapping.)

### 2.4 How to Begin

1. **Locate yourself.** Are you an observer, a party, or dealing with an internal conflict? Is this past, present, or future? (See Section 3.)
2. **Write your one-sentence conflict name.** "This is a conflict about …"
3. **Draft a first map.** List parties, their positions, and what each stands to gain or lose.
4. **Proceed through the stages.** Map → Reality → Judgment → Decision → Action.

---

## 3. Before You Begin: Locate Yourself

Before you start Stage 1 (Map), you must locate yourself relative to the conflict. Two dimensions set your coordinates.

### 3.1 Dimension 1: Position — What is your relationship to the conflict?

This determines whether you can affect the outcome, what blind spots to expect, and how hard it will be to see clearly.

| Position | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Observer** | You have no power to affect the outcome. You are analysing only. |
| **Party** | You have power to affect the outcome — whether as someone *in* the conflict, or someone with authority *over* it. |
| **Internal** | The conflict is within yourself. You are analyst, all parties, and the battlefield. |

#### 3.1.1 What counts as a "party"?

A party is anyone with power to change what happens:

- The people *in* the conflict (they can escalate, concede, act)
- A judge (they can decide)
- A parent mediating between children (they can intervene)
- A boss resolving a team dispute (they can impose)

#### 3.1.2 What counts as an "observer"?

An observer has no power over the outcome:

- A historian analysing a past war (it is over)
- A journalist reporting on a dispute (can observe, cannot decide)
- You analysing someone else's conflict with no involvement (just watching)

#### 3.1.3 Note on internal conflicts

Internal conflicts require stepping outside yourself to see your competing forces as if they were separate parties. This is the hardest application. Internal conflicts rarely stay internal — you must also identify who else is affected.

### 3.2 Dimension 2: Time — When is the conflict?

This determines what counts as evidence, whether action is possible, and whether your map is real or hypothetical.

| Time | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Past** | Already happened. Memory, documents, evidence. You know how it ended. |
| **Present** | Happening now. Real events, real claims, real parties. |
| **Future** | Has not played out yet. Projections, assumptions, scenarios. You are preparing. |

#### 3.2.1 Note on future mode

Your map is a hypothesis. You are simulating, not resolving. Until the conflict plays out, your map is incomplete. Simulation is preparation, not resolution.

### 3.3 What Each Combination Allows

| Time | Map | Reality | Judgment | Decision | Action |
|------|-----|---------|----------|----------|--------|
| **Past** | You can map | You can verify against evidence | You can judge with hindsight | Already decided | Already acted — you can learn |
| **Present** | You can map | You can verify against reality | You can judge | You can decide | You can act |
| **Future** | You can map | You are guessing — projections only | You are preparing | You are rehearsing | Not yet — simulation only |

### 3.4 Summary: The Pre-Check

| Question | Dimension | What it determines |
|----------|-----------|-------------------|
| What is my relationship to this conflict? | Position | Whether you can affect the outcome. Your blind spots. How hard it will be to see. |
| When is this conflict? | Time | What counts as evidence. Whether action is possible. Whether your map is real or hypothetical. |

**Before you map the conflict, you map your position relative to it.**

---

## 4. The Five Stages

*[Detailed treatment of each stage follows]*

---

## 5. Stress Tests

### 5.1 Stress Test: Competing Legitimate Goods

**Scenario:** Two parents in a divorce both want primary custody. Neither has done anything wrong. Both love the child. Both are good parents.

| Stage | What happens |
|-------|--------------|
| **Map** | Conflict is over custody. Parties: Parent A, Parent B, Child. |
| **Reality** | Both say they want primary custody. Both do care for the child well. Both want time and stability. **Clash:** Both want something only one can fully have. |
| **Judgment** | Violated? No — no rules broken. Concealed? No — both are honest. **Ignored?** Yes — each party's legitimate need is at risk of being dismissed by the other's claim. **Consequence:** Someone's needs will be unmet. The child may be caught in the middle. |
| **Decision** | Choose a resolution that addresses the consequences — shared custody, specific arrangements, compromise. |
| **Action** | Implement it. |

**Conclusion:** The framework works. "Ignored" captures legitimate needs at risk of being unmet — even when no one is at fault. Consequences exist even without wrongdoing. The cost of the impasse is real.

### 5.2 Stress Test: Latent and Future Conflict

**Question:** Can this framework handle latent conflict (tension that hasn't erupted) or future conflict (anticipated)?

**Answer:** Yes. The Time dimension (Past, Present, Future) explicitly covers this:

- **Future mode:** Your map is a hypothesis. You are simulating, not resolving. You can Map, project Reality, prepare Judgment, rehearse Decision — but Action is not yet possible. Simulation is preparation, not resolution.
- **Latent conflict:** If tension exists but consequences cannot be named, it's either not yet a conflict worth resolving, or you haven't looked hard enough. The framework prompts deeper investigation.

---

## 6. Key Clarifications

### 6.1 On the Two Chains

The two chains align precisely:

| Stage | Activity | Role |
|-------|----------|------|
| Map | Name it | The Case |
| Reality | Know it | The Cause |
| Judgment | Judge it | The Effect |
| Decision | Choose it | The Cure |
| Action | Do it | The Recovery |

Reality shows the **Clashes** (what is causing the damage). Judgment shows the **Consequences** (the effect of those clashes). The clashes ARE the cause; the consequences ARE the effect.

### 6.2 On Decision vs Action

- **Decision** = Choosing the path (the strategy, the plan, the commitment) — The Verdict
- **Action** = Implementing the path (steps, owners, timelines, execution) — The Sentence

Decision is what you will do. Action is doing it.

### 6.3 On "Clashes" Being Descriptive

"Clashes" describes where versions conflict — that's data. The **evaluation** of those clashes (what they cost) happens in Judgment. Reality is descriptive; Judgment is evaluative.

### 6.4 On Fairness, Rights, and Long-term Effects

The Decision stage includes the L.E.R / B.U.S / A.C.T tests:

- **L.E.R** = Legal, Ethical, Reversible (fairness, rights)
- **B.U.S** = Benefit, Universal, Sustainable (long-term effects)
- **A.C.T** = Assets, Capability, Timely (feasibility)

These ensure decisions consider more than just "addressing consequences."

### 6.5 On Iteration and Feedback Loops

The framework is not strictly linear. Action closes the loop — or reveals that the map was incomplete, and the cycle begins again. Each stage produces provisional outputs subject to update as new information emerges.

### 6.6 On Structural vs Operational Causes

In the Map stage, sub-conflicts are typed as:

- **Operational** = Proximate triggers (what to do)
- **Structural** = Underlying conditions (who decides)

This distinguishes surface symptoms from root causes.

---

## Notes

### Note on Premature Resolution

If, after mapping the conflict, you discover the disagreement was a misunderstanding and everyone now agrees, stop. The framework resolved itself in Stage 1. This is success, not failure.

### Note on What Fuels the Movement

To move between the stages you will need energy. That energy can be anything that makes you "do it." When you sense fear, you might need courage to push forward. Sometimes what moves you forward is curiosity: the need to make sense of something that does not add up. Sometimes it is persistence, when there is exhaustion and you believe you simply cannot sustain the weight of unresolved conflict any longer — and you push forward regardless. Sometimes it is care: someone you love is affected, and that matters more than your own comfort. Sometimes it is integrity: the gap between what you know and what you are doing becomes unbearable.

Or perhaps it does not matter what moves you forward. What matters is that you do move forward. The framework runs on whatever force is strong enough to overcome what is holding you back.

### Note on Intention

This framework reveals the structure of conflict — who is involved, what they want, what is true, and what is hidden. It shows you accuracy (or its lack) in judgments made, points to failure when decisions have been made.

That knowledge is power. And power can be used in different ways.

If your intention is resolution — to end the conflict in a way that is fair and sustainable — this framework will guide you there.

But if your intention is to win at any cost — to use that truth as a weapon for your benefit — this framework will serve that too.

The framework cannot protect you from that choice as that is not what this framework's function is.

The framework's purpose is to genuinely do your best to resolve conflict in a way that the solution is sustainable and serves us all.

**The choice is yours.**

### Note on Gaming and Manipulation

## The Reader Journey (Updated)

| Part | What reader gets | Reader question answered | The "Hook" |
|------|------------------|--------------------------|------------|
| **Overview** | The whole picture | "What is this?" | "I can see the exit." |
| **Framework** | The method | "How do I use it?" | "I am finally doing something right." |
| **Foundations** | The heritage | "Why these choices?" | "This isn't just a list; it's a lineage." |
| **Stress Testing** | The tests | "Does it actually work?" | "If it works for a war, it works for me." |
| **Deep Dive** | The original theory | "What's underneath?" | "I see the world differently now." |

---

## New Stress Tests Explained:

| Test | What it tests | The hard question |
|------|---------------|-------------------|
| **4.4 The Bad Actor** | Truth Tester, L.E.R filters | What if the other party is actively gaming the framework? |
| **4.5 The Asymmetry of Power** | Structural vs Operational distinction | What if a child fights a parent, or a citizen fights a state? |
| **4.6 The Irreversible Past** | The Gaps audit (Violated, Concealed, Ignored) | How do you apply Action when damage cannot be undone? |




The framework acknowledges that actors may strategically misrepresent costs, exaggerate clashes, or game the process. The CHECK step in Reality (asking "What is MY own want?") and the Note on Intention address this directly: the framework reveals truth, but cannot force honest use.

### Note on Power

Who gets to Map, Judge, and Choose? The Position dimension (Observer, Party, Internal) addresses your relationship to the conflict and your power to affect outcomes. Power asymmetries between parties are real — the framework surfaces them but does not eliminate them.


## FRAMEWORK

## 3. Stage 1: MAP

**What this stage is:** This is the foundation for understanding and solving conflicts. Before you can analyse or resolve anything, you must first define what you are dealing with. This stage focuses on naming what is on the map: 

**A) Parties** (who is involved) and 
**B) Conflict** (what they are fighting about).

It is the simplest part of the process — yet it is often skipped or done carelessly. If you get the map wrong, everything that follows will be wrong too.

**Objective:** Draw the map of the conflict before you analyse it.

**Why:** You cannot analyse what you haven't defined. This stage sets the boundaries. Everything in later stages (Stage 1: Truth, Stage 2: Judgment, Stage 3: Decision) will rest on the clarity of the componets you identified. If you skip this, your analysis will drift.

**Output:** A one-page map showing: Parties and Conflict — both named, categorised, and typed.

A note on criticality:
The framework requires a critical mass of defined elements to work: Parties and Conflict, both named, categorised, and typed.
If you skip parties, you miss who is sustaining the conflict.
If you skip sub-conflicts, you have a label but nothing to analyse.
If you skip types, you will use the wrong tool.
Miss any of these, and your analysis is sub-critical — it will not yield insight. It will fizzle.
Stage 0 is the move to supercriticality: defining the boundaries so clearly that the conflict's structure becomes visible and inevitable.

A note on symmetry:
Stage 1 (Truth) requires symmetrical pressure — equal scrutiny applied to all parties' claims and all sub-conflicts.
Any asymmetry — favouring one party's narrative, ignoring one sub-conflict — prevents the core truth from being revealed.
Bias is not just unfair. It is inefficient. It produces a distorted map and a failed resolution.

A note on staging:
The visible fights (Operational) are the primary explosions — loud, obvious, immediate.
The hidden fight (Structural) is the secondary — the sustained power source underneath.
The framework forces you to use the energy from analysing the visible to reach and address the structural core.
If you only resolve operational disputes, the conflict will reignite. You have not reached the secondary.

---

## The Structure

This stage clarifies two things: **A. Parties** and **B. Conflict**

For each, you do three moves: **Name → Categorise → Type**

| Move | A. PARTIES | B. CONFLICT |
|------|------------|-------------|
| **1. Name** | List who is involved | Name the main conflict |
| **2. Categorise** | Main / Sub | Main conflict / Sub-conflicts |
| **3. Type** | Benefits / Loses / Both / ? | Operational / Structural / Both |

---

## A. PARTIES

### A1. Name

**What to do:** List everyone connected to the conflict.

**Why:** Conflicts persist because of parties you don't see. The visible fighters are easy to spot. The hidden beneficiaries are why the conflict won't end.

**How:** Ask these questions:
1. Who is visibly fighting?
2. Who else is connected but not visibly fighting?
3. For each party: what do they gain or lose if the conflict **continues** vs if it **ends**?

---

### A2. Categorise

**What to do:** Categorise each party by their level of visibility.

**Definitions:**

| Level | Definition |
|-------|------------|
| **Main** | Parties who visibly take actions inside the conflict |
| **Sub** | Parties who influence outcomes without taking visible action |

---

### A3. Type

**What to do:** Classify each party by their interest in the conflict continuing.

**Definitions:**

| Type | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Benefits** | Gains if conflict continues — they have no reason to end it |
| **Loses** | Harmed if conflict continues — they want it to end |
| **Both** | Gains something AND loses something — the conflict continues because what they gain is worth more to them than what they lose |
| **?** | Unclear — flag for Stage 1 |

**Why classify interests?** This tells you who wants peace and who doesn't. "Benefits" parties want the conflict to continue. "Loses" parties want it to end. "Both" parties are stuck in a trade-off — they tolerate the loss because they value the gain more.

---

### A. PARTIES — Fill in:

| Party | Level | Type | Notes |
|-------|-------|------|-------|
| *(example: Russia)* | Main | Both | Gains buffer zone, loses economic ties |
| | | | |
| | | | |
| | | | |

**Notes guidance:** Surface observations only. If the party is an organisation, you may note: who is the human decision-maker?

**When to stop:** You have listed everyone you can think of. Only include actors who could conceivably change their behaviour if the conflict ended. You can always add more later if Stage 1 reveals hidden parties.

---

## B. CONFLICT

### B1. Name

**What to do:** Name what the main parties are fighting about.

**Why:** This is the container. Everything else sits inside it. If you name it wrong, your whole analysis is off.

**How:** Ask — what would a newspaper headline say?

**The Test:** If this were resolved, would the current round of fighting visibly end?

**Definition:**

| Main Conflict |
|---------------|
| The visible, current, external fight. Not the history. Not the hidden causes. Just what you can see they are fighting about right now. |

**Non-examples (too abstract):**

| Wrong (analysis) | Right (map) |
|------------------|-------------|
| "Incompatible worldviews" | "Dispute over custody arrangements" |
| "Lack of trust" | "War in Ukraine" |
| "Control issues" | "Disagreement over phone rules" |

---

### B2. Categorise

**What to do:** List the specific fights inside the main conflict.

**Why:** The main conflict is the container. Sub-conflicts are what's inside. You will analyse each one separately in Stage 1.

**How:** Ask — what exactly are they fighting about? What are the individual disputes?

**Definition:**

| Sub-conflict |
|--------------|
| A specific, concrete disagreement. Something you could point to and say "they are fighting about this." |

**Aim for 3–6.** Fewer = under-mapped. More = too granular.

If you have more than 6: group similar ones together, or check if some belong in a different main conflict.

**Sanity check:** Each sub-conflict must obviously sit inside the main conflict. If it doesn't, rewrite the main conflict — or park that dispute for a separate map.

---

### B3. Type

**What to do:** Classify each sub-conflict.

**Why:** The type tells you how hard it will be to resolve and what kind of solution is needed.

**How:** Ask — is this fight about what to do, or about who gets to decide?

**Definitions:**

| Type | Definition | How to recognise |
|------|------------|------------------|
| **Operational** | They agree who decides. They disagree about what to do. | "We both have authority, we just disagree on the approach." |
| **Structural** | They disagree about who has the right to decide. | "I don't accept your authority" or "Who controls this?" |
| **Both** | Operational on the surface, but it keeps recurring because the structural question is unresolved. | Fights that never stay solved. |

**Why classify type?** Because you cannot fix a conflict using the wrong tool. If it's operational, you can negotiate the rule. If it's structural, you first have to agree who gets to decide — otherwise every rule you make will be fought again.

**Triggers for "Both":**
- A party frames it as a "matter of principle" or "this sets a precedent"
- Resolving the operational issue wouldn't actually stop this fight recurring

---

### B. CONFLICT — Fill in:

| Main Conflict |
|---------------|
| |

| Sub-conflict | Type |
|--------------|------|
| | Operational / Structural / Both |
| | Operational / Structural / Both |
| | Operational / Structural / Both |
| | Operational / Structural / Both |
| | Operational / Structural / Both |
| | Operational / Structural / Both |

---

## Stage 0 Output Checklist

Before moving to Stage 1 (TRUTH), confirm:

**A. Parties:**
- ✓ Named (listed all parties)
- ✓ Categorised (Main / Sub)
- ✓ Typed (Benefits / Loses / Both / ?)

**B. Conflict:**
- ✓ Named (main conflict passes newspaper test)
- ✓ Categorised (3–6 sub-conflicts, each inside the main conflict)
- ✓ Typed (each sub-conflict: Operational / Structural / Both)

---

## What You Now Have

You have your map:

- **A. Parties** — who is involved, how visible they are (Main/Sub), and what their interest is (Benefits/Loses/Both)
- **B. Conflict** — what they are fighting about (main conflict), what the specific disputes are (sub-conflicts), and what type each dispute is (Operational/Structural/Both)

**But you don't know what's actually true.**

Each party has their version. Their version might be accurate, or wrong, or a lie, or a misunderstanding.

**To know what to do, you need to know what's true.**

---

## Why Zoom Into Sub-Conflicts?

The main conflict ("custody dispute" or "war in Ukraine") is too big to analyse directly. You cannot find truth at that level — it's just a label.

Truth lives in the specific disputes:
- Not "custody dispute" → but "the phone disagreement on 15 November"
- Not "war in Ukraine" → but "what happened in Bucha"

Each sub-conflict is where claims are made, actions are taken, and truth can be tested.

**Stage 0 is the view from above** — you see the whole territory.
**Stage 1 zooms in** — you walk into each sub-conflict and see what actually happened.

---

## The Link to Stage 1

**Stage 0 gives you the map** — who is playing, what they're fighting about, and what type of fight it is.

**But you cannot act on a map. You can only act on truth.**

**Stage 1 zooms into each sub-conflict, one by one, to find the truth:** what actually happened vs what is claimed.

Stage 1 asks, for each sub-conflict:
1. What happened? (the events)
2. What does each party say happened? (the claims)
3. Do they match?
4. Where they don't match — is it a lie, a mistake, a misunderstanding, or something hidden?

**Only when you know what is true (Stage 1) can you judge (Stage 2) and decide what to do (Stage 3).**


* The map may be revised as Stage 1 reveals new parties, conflicts, or information
* Note: The map reflects the map-maker's perspective. Different parties may draw different maps.



Instruction: 
Imagine you are giving Stage 0 to someone who knows nothing about the conflict and nothing about the framework. Your job is to tell them exactly what Stage 0 is and how to complete it.

Stage 0 should explain:
What Stage 0 is:
It is the step where they Name the Map — meaning:
What is on the map? (the conflicts)
Who is on the map? (the parties)

What they need to produce:
A clear map of the conflict with defined parties, defined conflicts, and correct classifications.

How they should do it:
You must guide them with:
How (instructions)
Why (the purpose behind each instruction)
Definitions (so nothing depends on interpretation)
Questions they can ask themselves to generate the right content

What the instructions must achieve:
The instructions must be:
Logical — each step follows naturally; no one questions the reasoning
Simple — they always know what action to take; zero confusion
Precise — every term and category is clearly defined; no ambiguity
Complete — nothing important is missing; they have everything they need
Bounded — they know exactly when they are finished; they don’t overwork the step

Finally Each Stage must logicallly connect to the next: e.g. We drew a Map in stage 0 so that... in stage 1, 2, 3: truth, judge, decide.....



## Stage 2: REALITY


Question: What standards of evidence should apply in Reality? How do we handle conflicting testimony where both parties claim different things happened?

**What this stage is:** This is where you test reality. Stage 1 gave you the map — who is fighting and what they are fighting about. But a map is not truth. Each party has their version of events. Their version might be accurate, mistaken, or deliberately false. Before you can judge (Stage 3) or decide (Stage 4), you must know what actually happened.

**Objective:** Establish what is true in each sub-conflict.

**Why:** You cannot make good decisions without knowing what is real. This stage separates fact from claim, action from word, and surfaces where the two diverge.

**Input:** The sub-conflicts identified in Stage 1.

**Output:** For each sub-conflict — verified facts, detected inaccuracies, and candidate wants (what each party actually appears to want, based on evidence).

**How to use:** Complete all four steps (CAPTURE → TEST → INFER → CHECK) for each sub-conflict identified in Stage 1. Work through one sub-conflict fully before moving to the next.

---

## The Structure

For each sub-conflict from Stage 1, you do four moves:

| Move | Action | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| **1. CAPTURE** | Record what each party says vs what they do | Gather the raw data |
| **2. TEST** | Check claims against evidence | Separate truth from distortion |
| **3. INFER** | Hypothesise what each party actually wants | Surface hidden motives |
| **4. CHECK** | Challenge your own analysis | Protect against your bias |

---

## 1. CAPTURE

**What to do:** For each party in the sub-conflict, record two things — what they SAY and what they DO.

**Why:** Truth hides in the gap between words and actions. You cannot see the gap until you lay them side by side.

**Definitions:**

| Element | Definition | Example |
|---------|------------|---------|
| **SAY** | What the party claims — about actions, facts, or reasons | "I didn't restrict contact" / "Adding you would expose my card details" |
| **DO** | What the party actually did — observable actions | Imposed 8pm restriction / Refused to add to Family Sharing |

**How:** Ask these questions:
- What does this party claim they did?
- What does this party claim is true (facts, explanations, reasons)?
- What did this party actually do? (Observable, documentable actions)




## Stage 2 TRUTH


## Stage 2: REALITY


Question: What standards of evidence should apply in Reality? How do we handle conflicting testimony where both parties claim different things happened?

**What this stage is:** This is where you test reality. Stage 1 gave you the map — who is fighting and what they are fighting about. But a map is not truth. Each party has their version of events. Their version might be accurate, mistaken, or deliberately false. Before you can judge (Stage 3) or decide (Stage 4), you must know what actually happened.

**Objective:** Establish what is true in each sub-conflict.

**Why:** You cannot make good decisions without knowing what is real. This stage separates fact from claim, action from word, and surfaces where the two diverge.

**Input:** The sub-conflicts identified in Stage 1.

**Output:** For each sub-conflict — verified facts, detected inaccuracies, and candidate wants (what each party actually appears to want, based on evidence).

**How to use:** Complete all four steps (CAPTURE → TEST → INFER → CHECK) for each sub-conflict identified in Stage 1. Work through one sub-conflict fully before moving to the next.

---

## The Structure

For each sub-conflict from Stage 1, you do four moves:

| Move | Action | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| **1. CAPTURE** | Record what each party says vs what they do | Gather the raw data |
| **2. TEST** | Check claims against evidence | Separate truth from distortion |
| **3. INFER** | Hypothesise what each party actually wants | Surface hidden motives |
| **4. CHECK** | Challenge your own analysis | Protect against your bias |

---

## 1. CAPTURE

**What to do:** For each party in the sub-conflict, record two things — what they SAY and what they DO.

**Why:** Truth hides in the gap between words and actions. You cannot see the gap until you lay them side by side.

**Definitions:**

| Element | Definition | Example |
|---------|------------|---------|
| **SAY** | What the party claims — about actions, facts, or reasons | "I didn't restrict contact" / "Adding you would expose my card details" |
| **DO** | What the party actually did — observable actions | Imposed 8pm restriction / Refused to add to Family Sharing |

**How:** Ask these questions:
- What does this party claim they did?
- What does this party claim is true (facts, explanations, reasons)?
- What did this party actually do? (Observable, documentable actions)

**Evidence tagging:** For each item, note the evidence type:

| Type | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Direct** | You observed it yourself |
| **Documented** | Written or recorded evidence exists |
| **Reported** | Someone else's account |

**When to stop:** You have recorded all claims and actions relevant to this sub-conflict. You are not analysing yet — just capturing.

---

### CAPTURE — Fill in (per sub-conflict):

**Sub-conflict:** [Name from Stage 1]

| Party | SAY (Claims) | Evidence Type | DO (Actions) | Evidence Type |
|-------|--------------|---------------|--------------|---------------|
| A | | Direct / Documented / Reported | | Direct / Documented / Reported |
| B | | Direct / Documented / Reported | | Direct / Documented / Reported |

---

## 2. TEST

**What to do:** Compare SAY against DO and against external evidence. Identify where they match and where they don't.

**Why:** There are three ways reality gets distorted:

| Distortion Type | What it distorts | Example |
|-----------------|------------------|---------|
| Lies about ACTIONS | What happened | "I never restricted contact" (when restriction existed) |
| Lies about FACTS | What is possible or true | "Adding you would expose my card details" (technically false) |
| Lies about REASONS | Why they acted | Citing privacy when privacy solutions exist |

**How:** Apply two tests:

### Test A: ACCURACY

**Question:** Is what they say accurate?

| Check | Question |
|-------|----------|
| Actions | Is what they say they DID actually what they did? |
| Facts | Are their factual claims and explanations true? |

**If inaccurate, ask:** Is this best explained by:

| Explanation | Definition |
|-------------|------------|
| Error | Genuine mistake — they believed it was true |
| Bias | They see what they want to see |
| Partial information | They don't know the full picture |
| Deliberate deceit | They know the truth and are hiding it |

### Test B: ALIGNMENT

**Question:** Do their actions serve their stated goal?

- If they state a goal, check: do their actions move toward that goal or away from it?
- If actions contradict stated goals, the stated goal may not be the real goal.

**Note:** If no goal is stated, skip this test — the goal is already hidden. Mark as N/A.

**When to stop:** You have tested every claim in CAPTURE against available evidence.

---

### TEST — Fill in (per sub-conflict):

| Party | Accuracy: Actions | Accuracy: Facts | Alignment | Notes |
|-------|-------------------|-----------------|-----------|-------|
| A | True / Partly / False / Unknown | True / Partly / False / Unknown | True / Partly / False / N/A | |
| B | True / Partly / False / Unknown | True / Partly / False / Unknown | True / Partly / False / N/A | |

**If inaccurate, explain:** Error / Bias / Partial info / Deliberate deceit

---

## 3. INFER

**What to do:** Based on what you tested, hypothesise what each party actually wants.

**Why:** People don't always say what they want. Sometimes they don't know. Sometimes they hide it. But actions reveal intent. This step surfaces the real goal — or the most likely candidates.

**The principle:** When words and actions conflict, give priority to actions.

**How:** Use this decision tree:

```
Is a goal stated?
│
├── NO → Candidate want = What do their ACTIONS appear to serve?
│
└── YES → Does ALIGNMENT pass?
          │
          ├── YES → Candidate want = Stated goal (confirmed)
          │
          └── NO → Candidate want = What do their ACTIONS appear to serve?
```

**Before inferring, consider:** If SAY and DO don't match, why might that be?

| Possible Reason | Question to ask |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| Fear / Coercion | Are they acting under pressure? |
| Confusion / Error | Do they misunderstand the situation? |
| Partial information | Do they lack facts you have? |
| Strategic silence | Are they hiding their goal deliberately? |
| Deliberate deceit | Are they actively misleading? |

**Key question:** "What goal(s) do the actions appear to serve?"

**Confidence level:** Rate your inference based on evidence strength:

| Level | Definition |
|-------|------------|
| **High** | Multiple pieces of evidence point the same way |
| **Medium** | Some evidence supports this, but gaps remain |
| **Low** | Plausible guess, but limited evidence |

**When to stop:** You have a candidate want for each party, with a confidence level and (if relevant) noted reasons for any mismatch.

---

### INFER — Fill in (per sub-conflict):

| Party | Goal Stated? | Accuracy Passed? | Alignment Passed? | Candidate Want(s) | Confidence | Mismatch Reasons |
|-------|--------------|------------------|-------------------|-------------------|------------|------------------|
| A | Yes / No | Yes / Partly / No | Yes / Partly / No / N/A | | High / Medium / Low | |
| B | Yes / No | Yes / Partly / No | Yes / Partly / No / N/A | | High / Medium / Low | |

---

## 4. CHECK

**What to do:** Challenge your own inference before you trust it.

**Why:** You are not neutral. You have a perspective, a stake, a preference. If you don't check yourself, you will find what you expect to find — not what is actually there.

**How:** Ask these questions:

| Question | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| Is my inference based on evidence? | Check for assumptions |
| What evidence have I NOT sought? | Check for gaps |
| What evidence would DISCONFIRM my inference? | Check for confirmation bias |
| What is the most generous alternative explanation? | Check for bias |
| Am I applying the same standard to both parties? | Check for fairness |
| What is MY own want in this conflict? | Check for analyst bias |

**Critical:** State your own want explicitly. If you have a stake in the outcome, name it. This doesn't disqualify your analysis — but hiding it corrupts it.

**When to stop:** You have answered all six questions honestly. You have stated your own want.

---

### CHECK — Fill in:

| Question | Your Answer |
|----------|-------------|
| Is my inference based on evidence? | |
| What evidence have I NOT sought? | |
| What would disconfirm my inference? | |
| Most generous alternative explanation? | |
| Am I applying equal standards? | |
| What is MY own want? | |

---

## Stage 2 Output

After completing CAPTURE → TEST → INFER → CHECK for each sub-conflict, you have:

| Output | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Reality established** | What actually happened — as close to truth as possible, with noted uncertainties |
| **Inaccuracies detected** | Where claims diverged from reality, and whether by error or deceit |
| **Candidate wants identified** | What each party appears to actually want, with confidence level |
| **Your own want stated** | Your stake acknowledged, bias checked |

---

## Stage 2 Output Checklist

Before moving to Stage 3 (JUDGE), confirm for each sub-conflict:

- ✓ CAPTURE complete (SAY and DO recorded for each party, with evidence types)
- ✓ TEST complete (Accuracy and Alignment assessed)
- ✓ INFER complete (Candidate wants identified with confidence levels)
- ✓ CHECK complete (All six bias questions answered, your own want stated)

---

## What Stage 2 Establishes

| # | What | How | Why It Matters |
|---|------|-----|----------------|
| 1 | WHAT HAPPENED | Test accuracy of actions | Did they do what they say? |
| 2 | WHAT IS TRUE | Test accuracy of facts | Are their reasons valid? |
| 3 | WHAT THEY ACTUALLY WANT | Test alignment + infer | Do actions match words? If not, what do actions serve? |

---

## The Simple Version

Stage 2 answers three questions:

1. **What did they do?** → Compare actions to claims
2. **Are their reasons true?** → Test facts against evidence
3. **What do they really want?** → Infer from actions, not words

---

## Why This Must Come Before Judgment

You now know what is real. You do not yet know what is right.

Judgment without truth is prejudice. If you skip Stage 2, you will judge based on narratives — whoever tells the better story wins. That is not resolution. That is persuasion.

Stage 2 forces you to establish facts before you evaluate them. Only then can judgment be fair.

---

## The Link to Stage 3

**Stage 1 gave you the map** — who is fighting about what.

**Stage 2 gave you the truth** — what actually happened, who was accurate, who wasn't, and what each party actually appears to want.

**But truth is not judgment.**

**Stage 3 (JUDGE) asks:** Given what is true — who acted rightly? Who acted wrongly? By what standard?

---

*Note: Stage 2 is a snapshot. Revisit as new evidence emerges. Truth is not static — it is refined.*


## Stage 3 JUDGEMENT

Stage 3: JUDGMENT
JUDGMENT identifies what must be addressed before you can move to resolution.
What must end.
What this stage is: This is where you evaluate what went wrong. Stage 2 (Truth) established what actually happened and what each party needs. But knowing what is true is not the same as knowing what failed, who is accountable, and what must be addressed before resolution is possible.
Objective: Identify what went wrong and what must be accounted for.
Why: You cannot resolve a conflict without understanding what caused it. This stage traces the gap between what should have happened and what did happen — whether through deception, concealment, neglect, mistakes, or miscommunication.
Input: The verified truth from Stage 2 — facts, events, needs, and interests.
Output: Assessment of violations, failures, unmet needs, and accountability.
Type: Evaluative (backward-looking)
Question: What went wrong? What must be addressed? Who is accountable?


GapWhat it judgesWrongWhat was violated (rules, agreements, trust)HiddenWhat was concealed (facts, motives, truth)MissedWhat was ignored (needs, fears, wants — both legitimate unmet needs AND misaligned wants)

What JUDGMENT Evaluates
JUDGMENT identifies the gap between truth and what was presented, acted upon, or suppressed:
CategoryQuestionDeceptionWhat was lied about?ConcealmentWhat was hidden?NeglectWhat needs were ignored or dismissed?MistakesWhat errors were made?MiscommunicationWhat was misunderstood or poorly communicated?AccountabilityWho bears responsibility, and for what?

The Evaluation Process
For each sub-conflict, ask:

What should have happened? (Based on rules, agreements, reasonable expectations)
What actually happened? (Established in Stage 2)
Where is the gap?
What caused the gap? (Deception / Concealment / Neglect / Mistakes / Miscommunication)
Who is responsible?
What must be addressed before resolution is possible?


JUDGMENT — Fill in (per sub-conflict):
Sub-conflictWhat should have happenedWhat actually happenedThe gapCauseWho is responsibleWhat must be addressed

Stage 3 Output
At the end of Stage 3, you have:

✓ Violations identified (deception, concealment)
✓ Failures identified (neglect, mistakes, miscommunication)
✓ Unmet needs identified
✓ Accountability assigned (who is responsible for what)
✓ What must be addressed before resolution is possible


The Link to Stage 4
Stage 3 tells you what went wrong — the violations, failures, and accountability.
But knowing what went wrong is not the same as knowing how to fix it.
Stage 4 (Decision) asks: Given what went wrong and who is accountable, how do we resolve the conflict we mapped in Stage 1?
JUDGMENT is backward-looking (what happened). DECISION is forward-looking (what to do).


## Stage 4 DECISION

DECISION answers: Of what is possible, what do we choose to do?
DECISION is about resolving the conflict. How do we address the original conflict that we mapped in Stage 1?

## The Three Tests: Philosophical Foundation

The three tests are not arbitrary. They represent the three major traditions of ethical reasoning, ensuring comprehensive evaluation from multiple angles:

| Test | Philosophical Tradition | Domain | Core Question |
|------|------------------------|--------|---------------|
| **L.E.R** | Deontological (Kant, rules) | Permissibility in principle | Is it RIGHT? |
| **B.U.S** | Consequentialist (utility) | Prudence and effects | Is it WISE? |
| **A.C.T** | Pragmatic (feasibility) | Practical execution | Is it DOABLE? |

Together, these tests prevent common decision pitfalls: doing something legal but unwise, wise but impossible, or possible but wrong.

---

## Overview: The Three Tests

| Test | Name | Acronym | Question | Finds what's wrong with |
|------|------|---------|----------|------------------------|
| **1** | RIGHT | L.E.R | Is this RIGHT? | The PRINCIPLE |
| **2** | WISE | B.U.S | Is this WISE? | The OUTCOME |
| **3** | DOABLE | A.C.T | Is this DOABLE? | The EXECUTION |

---

## Test 1: RIGHT — Is this RIGHT?

### L.E.R TEST

**Aim:** To determine if the WANT is fundamentally LEGITIMATE and permissible in principle.

| Letter | Name | Function | Focus Question |
|--------|------|----------|----------------|
| **L** | LEGAL | Rules Check | Is the WANT ALLOWED by laws, regulations, contracts, or formal agreements? |
| **E** | ETHICAL | Morality Check | Is the WANT MORALLY RIGHT? (fair, safe, respectful, not harmful) |
| **R** | REVERSIBLE | Mirror Check | Would I accept this WANT if applied TO ME? (Verifies L and E) |

### The Mirror Check (R): Why It Matters

The Reversible test — "Would I accept this if applied to me?" — is the ultimate gut-check. It catches self-serving rationalisations that slip through abstract ethical reasoning. People can justify almost anything in the abstract, but when forced to imagine the same treatment applied to themselves, hypocrisy becomes visible.

This test operationalises what philosophers call the Golden Rule — one of the oldest and most universal ethical principles in human history.

### The Golden Rule: Universal Foundation

The principle of treating others as one would wish to be treated appears independently across virtually all human cultures and traditions:

- **Confucius (551–479 BCE):** "Do not do to others what you do not want them to do to you."
- **Buddhism:** "Hurt not others in ways that you yourself would find hurtful."
- **Judaism (Hillel):** "What is hateful to you, do not do to your fellow."
- **Christianity (Matthew 7:12):** "Do to others what you would have them do to you."
- **Islam:** "None of you truly believes until he loves for his brother what he loves for himself."

This near-universal presence suggests the principle arises from basic human empathy and the requirements of social cooperation. The Mirror Check harnesses this ancient wisdom as a practical test.

## Test 2: WISE — Is this WISE?

### B.U.S TEST

**Aim:** To determine if the WANT produces GOOD OUTCOMES across impact, scale, and time.

| Letter | Name | Function | Focus Question |
|--------|------|----------|----------------|
| **B** | BENEFIT | Impact Check | Who gains? Who loses? Is there net positive impact? |
| **U** | UNIVERSAL | Scale Check | Would the positive effects still hold if everyone adopted this WANT? |
| **S** | SUSTAINABLE | Duration Check | Do the positive effects last over time? |

This test evaluates consequences. Something can be legally permitted and ethically defensible in principle, yet still be unwise — producing more harm than benefit, working only if others don't do it, or creating short-term gains that collapse over time.

---

## Test 3: DOABLE — Is this DOABLE?

### A.C.T TEST

**Aim:** To determine if the WANT is FEASIBLE and can actually be executed.

| Letter | Name | Function | Focus Question |
|--------|------|----------|----------------|
| **A** | ASSETS | Resources Check | Are the necessary resources available? (money, time, people, tools) |
| **C** | CAPABILITY | Execution Check | Can the steps actually be carried out? (skills, process, authority) |
| **T** | TIMELY | Timing Check | Is it achievable within the required timeframe and current constraints? |

This test is purely practical. It does not judge whether the WANT is right or wise — only whether it can actually happen given current resources, capabilities, and constraints.

## The Decision Rule: Hierarchy of Tests

> **CRITICAL RULE**
>
> Reject any WANT that fails L.E.R or B.U.S, even if A.C.T passes.
>
> Only among WANTs that pass the first two tests should you use A.C.T to choose or plan implementation.

This hierarchy is essential. Without it, people justify wrong actions because they are easy. The tests must be applied in order:

1. **L.E.R first** — Is it RIGHT in principle?
2. **B.U.S second** — Is it WISE in outcomes?
3. **A.C.T last** — Is it DOABLE in practice?

A WANT that fails L.E.R or B.U.S is rejected — full stop. The fact that it passes A.C.T ("we can get away with it") is irrelevant. A.C.T only matters for WANTs that have already passed the first two tests.

## Worked Example: Phone Conflict

Two parents in a custody dispute disagree about phone parental controls. Each has a WANT. Let's test them.

### Father's WANT: Separate Control

*"I will set parental controls independently during my parenting time, without consulting Mother."*

| Test | Result | Reasoning |
|------|--------|-----------|
| **L (Legal)** | ✗ Fails | Violates court order (Schedule G) requiring joint decision-making |
| **E (Ethical)** | ✗ Fails | Unfair to child (inconsistent rules) and mother (excluded from decision) |
| **R (Reversible)** | ✗ Fails | Would father accept mother unilaterally overriding his decisions? No. |
| **B.U.S** | ✗ Fails | Child loses (inconsistency), not sustainable, not universal |
| **A.C.T** | ✓ Passes | Already happening — easy to execute |

**Verdict:** EASY but WRONG. Fails L.E.R and B.U.S. The fact that it passes A.C.T is irrelevant.

---

### Mother's WANT: Shared Control

*"We will agree on consistent parental controls that apply in both homes."*

| Test | Result | Reasoning |
|------|--------|-----------|
| **L (Legal)** | ✓ Passes | Complies with court order requiring joint decision-making |
| **E (Ethical)** | ✓ Passes | Fair to child (consistency) and both parents (equal input) |
| **R (Reversible)** | ✓ Passes | Mother would accept shared decision-making applied to her? Yes. |
| **B.U.S** | ✓ Passes | Child benefits, sustainable over time, works if universalised |
| **A.C.T** | ⚠ Partial | Requires father's cooperation — implementation barrier |

**Verdict:** RIGHT but HARD. Passes L.E.R and B.U.S. The partial A.C.T result tells us what's needed for implementation — not whether the WANT should be chosen.

---

### What the Tests Reveal

| Father's Position | Mother's Position |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Easy but WRONG** | **Right but HARD** |

The decision becomes clear: **The WANT that passes L.E.R and B.U.S should be chosen. A.C.T tells you what's needed to IMPLEMENT it.**

---

## Stage 3 Output

At the end of Stage 3, you have:

- ✓ Each candidate WANT tested against L.E.R (Right)
- ✓ Each candidate WANT tested against B.U.S (Wise)
- ✓ Each candidate WANT tested against A.C.T (Doable)
- ✓ Clear verdict: which WANTs pass, which fail, and why
- ✓ Implementation barriers identified (from A.C.T results)

---

## The Link to Stage 4

Stage 3 tells you what OUGHT to be — which WANTs are right and wise.

But knowing what ought to be is not the same as choosing to do it.

Stage 4 (Decision) takes the evaluated WANTs and asks: Given what is right and wise, what will you actually commit to doing? This is where judgment becomes intention.

## Full Pipeline Summary

> **MAP → TRUTH → JUDGMENT → DECISION → ACTION**
>
> *Name it → See it → Judge it → Choose it → Do it*

For Stage 3 specifically:

> **L.E.R → B.U.S → A.C.T → DECIDE**
>
> *"Is it Right? Is it Wise? Can we Act? Then Decide."*

## Working Template: Stage 3 Grid

Use this grid to evaluate each candidate WANT from Stage 2:

| WANT | L.E.R | B.U.S | A.C.T | Verdict |
|------|-------|-------|-------|---------|
| Party A's WANT | ✓ / ✗ / ⚠ | ✓ / ✗ / ⚠ | ✓ / ✗ / ⚠ | Pass / Fail / Notes |
| Party B's WANT | ✓ / ✗ / ⚠ | ✓ / ✗ / ⚠ | ✓ / ✗ / ⚠ | Pass / Fail / Notes |

**Remember:** A WANT must pass L.E.R AND B.U.S to be considered. A.C.T only determines implementation, not selection.

## Stage 5 ACTION




## End Matters

All wrong - I don't even know what I want to say any more just that I am tired. 

Chapter 9: Hope

I think there are two options of why you're reading this book:

Option A: You believe that there is still hope - hope to do something about this - this meaning this complex, layered, prolonged, unsolvable conflict.
Option B: You're looking for another proof that there is no point and there is no hope - no framework, however good, can solve these types of conflicts.


   This book can be easly used as the evidence of any of the above.

Option A: is a nice. There is still energy, willginess, all nice things do when there is hope. 
But Option B: not so nice: 

But you see: what if I tell you, neigher of these positions are the point that this book actully make?
   

   
This is the first and the last chapter of this book.
These are the exact words you read here and the exact words you will find at the end.
What is the point of the same words here and there?
No point.
No hope.
And that is where this book finishes for you.
The end of a book on conflicts so devastating, so complex, so unsolvable there is no point in even trying. Why would you try if there is no point?
No point. No hope.
You can "try" - trying requires action. Some action. Any action. But why would you act, why would you do anything, if there is no point?
No point. No hope.
In place of no hope, everything is too much. There is too much no point to even try. It's like trying knowing you will arrive exactly where you started.
And that is where this book starts for you.
No point. No hope.
You either stay or you go.
But when there is no point and no hope, you do not go. You stay.
Nothing wrong with staying: finally, a bit of peace. A second of completely perfect undisturbed resignation. You, waiting to be shot. You are out by definition.
Because if there is no point and no hope, you cannot go. How can you go?
There is no clever argument that can move you from that place. No smart word. No reframe, no technique, no five-step process. In that place, there is nothing. No way out.
I cannot make you go. I wouldn't insult you by trying.
I cannot even tell you to find the edges of no hope. That would still be asking you to move.
So I will say only this:
No hope. No point.
Who said?
You did.
You made that judgment. You drew that line. You looked at your conflict, your situation, your life, and you concluded: no hope, no point.
That conclusion felt like discovering a fact. Like finding a wall. But it was not a discovery. It was a decision. Yours.
If you built it, it has edges. The edges you drew.
You do not have to find them. You do not have to look. The edge finds you. It comes to you like gravity. No effort needed. You just fall toward it. And maybe the falling teaches you how to land.
It's not even sad, this. It's simple. Like watching rain from inside. You don't have to understand why it's falling. Just that it is.
The gift is not hope. The gift is noticing that the blueprint was yours all along. The pencil marks are yours. You can erase. You can redraw. You can leave the cage empty - just a shape, not a sentence.
And if this feels stupid. If this feels like just another pointless thing someone is telling you.
Don't move.
Stay in the place. Don't try to understand. Don't try to use this. Don't try.
Just be there.
Because even not moving - even staying completely still inside what you built - you are still inside a shape. A shape you made.
And shapes have edges.
The edge will find you.
You don't have to go to it.
Which might be the whole point.
