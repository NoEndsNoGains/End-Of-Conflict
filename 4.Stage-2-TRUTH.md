Objective: Get as close to observable reality as possible																									
																									
Why: You cannot make a good decision without knowing what is real. Inaccuracies (lies/error) distort reality. Misalignment (contradictions) obscures reality. Both must be tested.																									
																									
Step 1: NAME																									
																									
Action: Identify the conflict.																									
																									
Question: What is the visible conflict? (Note multiple perspectives if known.)																									
																									
Step 2: MAP																									
																									
Action: Capture raw data for each party — without judgment. Tag evidence types.																									
																									
Element	Question	Evidence Type																							
A. SAY: Actions	What do they say they DID?	Direct / Documented / Reported																							
B. SAY: Facts	What factual claims, explanations, or reasons do they give?	Direct / Documented / Reported																							
C. SAY: End Goal	What do they say they WANT? (may be empty if not stated)	Direct / Documented / Reported																							
D. DO	What do they actually DO? (observable actions)	Direct / Documented / Reported																							
E. CONTEXT	What constraints, pressures, power differentials, or roles affect this party?	— e.g. CAO																							
																									
Evidence Types:																									
																									
Type	Definition																								
Direct	You observed it yourself																								
Documented	Written/recorded evidence																								
Reported	Someone else's claim																								
Step 3: TEST																									
																									
Action: Check for accuracy and alignment.																									
																									
Purpose: To get closer to reality.																									
																									
Test	Compare	Why	Question																						
ACCURACY: Actions	SAY: Actions vs Evidence	Inaccuracies distort what happened	Is what they say they DID accurate?																						
ACCURACY: Facts	SAY: Facts vs Evidence	Inaccuracies distort what is true	Are their claims/explanations accurate?																						
ALIGNMENT	DO vs SAY: End Goal	Misalignment obscures what they want	Do actions serve stated goal?																						
																									
Sub-question for ACCURACY tests:																									
																									
"If inaccurate, is this best explained by error, bias, partial information, or deliberate deceit?"																									
																									
Note: If no End Goal is stated, skip ALIGNMENT test — the goal is already hidden.																									
																									
Step 4: INFER																									
																									
Action: Hypothesise the real END GOAL(s).																									
																									
Warning: Inferring goals from actions is probabilistic, not certain. People may have multiple, conflicting motives (e.g., fear + control). Treat as a working hypothesis.																									
																									
Decision Tree:																									
																									
Is End Goal stated?																									
│																									
├── NO → Candidate WANT(s) = What ACTIONS appear to serve																									
│																									
└── YES → Does ALIGNMENT pass?																									
│																									
├── YES → Candidate WANT(s) = Stated End Goal																									
│																									
└── NO → Candidate WANT(s) = What ACTIONS appear to serve																									
																									
If SAY and DO conflict, list plausible reasons for mismatch BEFORE inferring:																									
																									
Possible Reason																									
Fear / Coercion																									
Confusion / Error																									
Partial information																									
Strategic silence																									
Deliberate deceit																									
																									
Key Question: "Give priority to actions while considering words and context. What goal(s) do the actions appear to serve?"																									
																									
Step 5: CHECK																									
																									
Action: Challenge your own inference and role.																									
																									
Question	Purpose																								
Is my inference based on evidence?	Check for assumptions																								
What evidence have I NOT sought?	Check for gaps																								
What evidence would DISCONFIRM my inference?	Check for confirmation bias																								
What is the most generous alternative explanation?	Check for bias																								
Am I applying the same standard to both parties?	Check for fairness																								
What is MY own WANT and role? How might it shape my interpretation?	Check for analyst bias

STAGE 1 SUMMARY:

1. NAME	Identify conflict	Focus																							
2. MAP	Capture SAY + DO + Context + Evidence Types	Raw data with source quality

Stage Establishes THREE Things:
#WhatHowWhy It Matters1WHAT HAPPENEDTest ACCURACY: ActionsDid they do what they say they did?2WHAT IS TRUETest ACCURACY: FactsAre their claims/reasons true?3WHAT THEY ACTUALLY WANTTest ALIGNMENT + INFERDo actions serve stated goals? If not, what do actions serve?

The Simple Version
Stage 1 answers:

What did they do? → He refused everything
Are their reasons true? → No, his reasons are false
What do they really want? → Separation, not privacy
---

# **Stage 1: TRUTH**

**Objective:** Establish what is true in each conflict
**Overivew:** 
---

## **Step 1: NAME**

**Question:** What are the conflicts and who are the parties?

| Conflict   | Party A | Party B |     ... |
| ---------- | ------- | ------- |-------  | 
| Conflict 1 |         |         |         |
| Conflict 2 |         |         |         |
| Conflict 3 |         |         |
|  .....     |         |         |

CHOICE NOTE / CONDITION???? You will be analysing Conflict by Conflict but it's imporant you name them first. 
---

## **Step 2: MAP**

**Question:** What happened and what is claimed?

### **DO (Happenings / What happened)**

| Party   | HAPPENED (DO) |
| ------- | ------------- |
| Party A |               |
| Party B |               |

### **SAY (Claims / What is claimed)**

| Party   | SAID (SAY) |
| ------- | ---------- |
| Party A |            |
| Party B |            |

**Instructions:** Fill in what actually happened (DO/HAPPENED) and what each party claims (SAY/SAID).

---

## **Step 3: TEST**

**Question:** Do DO and SAY match?

| Party   | DO + SAY Match? | Yes / No | Notes / Context |
| ------- | --------------- | -------- | --------------- |
| Party A |                 |          |                 |
| Party B |                 |          |                 |

---

This structure **flows naturally**:

1. Name the conflict and parties.
2. Record what happened vs what is claimed.
3. Test alignment and note mismatches.

If you like, I can **also make a visually polished version** with alternating row colors, headings in bold, and table borders that look very professional in Word — ready to drop in as a working template.

Do you want me to do that?
