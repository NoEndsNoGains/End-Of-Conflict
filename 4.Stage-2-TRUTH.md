# **Stage 1: TRUTH**

**Objective:** Establish what is true in each conflict
**Overivew:** 
---

## **Step 1: NAME**

**Question:** What are the conflicts and who are the parties?

| Conflict   | Party A | Party B |     ... |
| ---------- | ------- | ------- |-------  | 
| Conflict 1 |         |         |         |
| Conflict 2 |         |         |         |
| Conflict 3 |         |         |
|  .....     |         |         |

CHOICE NOTE / CONDITION???? You will be analysing Conflict by Conflict but it's imporant you name them first.

## **Step 2: MAP**

**Question:** What happened and what is claimed?

### **DO (Happenings / What happened)**

| Party   | HAPPENED (DO) |
| ------- | ------------- |
| Party A |               |
| Party B |               |

### **SAY (Claims / What is claimed)**

| Party   | SAID (SAY) |
| ------- | ---------- |
| Party A |            |
| Party B |            |

**Instructions:** Fill in what actually happened (DO/HAPPENED) and what each party claims (SAY/SAID).

---

## **Step 3: TEST**

**Question:** Do DO and SAY match?

| Party   | DO + SAY Match? | Yes / No | Notes / Context |
| ------- | --------------- | -------- | --------------- |
| Party A |                 |          |                 |
| Party B |                 |          |                 |

This structure **flows naturally**:

1. Name the conflict and parties.
2. Record what happened vs what is claimed.
3. Test alignment and note mismatches.

If you like, I can **also make a visually polished version** with alternating row colors, headings in bold, and table borders that look very professional in Word — ready to drop in as a working template.

Do you want me to do that?
