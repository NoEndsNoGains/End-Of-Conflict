### PARTIES

**Question:** Who benefits from conflict and who benefits from peace?

| | Benefits from CONFLICT | Benefits from PEACE |
|--|------------------------|---------------------|
| **How much?** | High / Medium / Low | High / Medium / Low |

---

So you map each person:

| Party | Benefits from Conflict | Benefits from Peace |
|-------|------------------------|---------------------|
| Father | ? | ? |
| Mother | ? | ? |
| Karen | ? | ? |
| Children | ? | ? |
| Husband | ? | ? |
| Russia | ? | ? |
| Ukraine | ? | ? |
| NATO | ? | ? |
| Civilians | ? | ? |
| Arms industry | ? | ? |

---

This replaces Direct / Driver / Affected / Collateral with something simpler and more revealing:

- **High conflict benefit, low peace benefit** = likely driver/sustainer
- **Low conflict benefit, high peace benefit** = likely affected/wants resolution
- **High both** = complicated incentives
- **Low both** = collateral / bystander

---

The role emerges from the grid. You don't have to classify them into categories first — you ask the question, and the pattern shows itself.

Is this closer?
